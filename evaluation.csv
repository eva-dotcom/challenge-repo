i really do not like this product because it makes my hair so greasy it looks like i put crisco in my hair it states that you should shake it   which is really hard to do because it is so thick   it leaves my scalp super greasy & my end dry  very unhappy about that  it does have a semi nice smell to it ,Positive
 you have to have this in your makeup this is the coolest palette that i have for my daughter  love the colors and the way the company match them up  in the morning when getting ready for school it makes it so easy to match your colors and be on your way never late to school and always looking so pretty  you can mac i have it but you pay big bucks for it and this is as good to me and get more of it then the higher price one i am 15 teen and have a real makeup collect as my mother calls it i am working on it hard love amazon and the prices a customer for life                ,Positive
 this product does cover ok but don t buy it if you have sensitive skin  once use and the areas i put it on were all burned red as in a sunburn  also  ordered in ivory to fair and came in fair to normal  once opened it can t be returned  ,Negative
these bath crystals don t bubble and have a most pleasant aroma   i love this product and find it is very soothing to the skin ,Positive
i had an original 413 for a few years and loved the brush until my dogs got ahold of it  mine was black so i ordered 1 of these because i was so glad i found them   they are crap and nothing like the original  don t order them  after a month the whole bristle part rubber and all came apart from the cheap handle  i never was so disappointed in my life  they cannot be real products of pm  he would not allow this cheap crap to have his name on it  i contacted the company bc when the brush arrived it was already missing bristles  i told them i didnt appreciate a crap knock off product i sent this email to them i received this item late and it was missing several bristles  i have previously owned this brush that i bought at a salon but my dogs ate it  i dont feel like this item was an authentic item as it was much lighter that the one i had and the quality was very poor heatherthe response from them was that they do not sell fakes and to send them pictures of the missing bristles  i did as they said and sent them the pictures on sept 22  to this day no response from them which shows me they dont stand behind their products and i hit the nail on the head when i said fake ,Negative
 can t use any of them and there are tons of lovely designs i tried  i work fast  use konad polishes and other polishes  own about 50 or so varnishes ranging from wet n wild to essie and sally hanson  all to no avail  the indentations are so shallow they don t allow for any stamping to occur  waste of money  i guess from good reviews  it s either hit or miss  i guess i got the short straw  can t return them but will contact the company to complain  thought all my family would love a set but won t order again  i followed all the directions  nothing would transfer at all  not happy camper  ,Negative
this color is absolutely hideous   it looks like i have pennies on all of my fingers   i was expecting this to be a gold glittery polish but i was wrong   its a pure copper color and does not look good with pale skin tones ,Negative
i started using glass nail files a few years ago and i could never use another type of nail file again   i have had good and bad ones from different companies   i decided to try these based on the reviews i have read and i have to say that these are the absolute best glass nail files that i have found   i am actually about to buy another set bc i only got to keep one for myself after handing out the others to family and friends   i highly recommend this product ,Positive
i personally can t really recommend this product as i don t feel it really made much difference with my hair  i probably will not be purchasing it again ,Negative
i don t like my nose it bothers me the price of this shaping tool is only around $3 or for me  i gave it a try andthere is no way this thing can make a nose smaller it s a good idea since a nose job is $ and insurance sadly doesn t pay for it i just don t think that wearing this everyday will make a permanent change or change at all ,Negative
i loved the color and the packaging and the primer and the brush    so beautiful     its a professional palette,Positive
 i have used this dust several days now and i have yet to determine if it is actually doing anything   it seems to work as more of a dry shampoo  removing oils from my hair  than a styling product   it does not say how much to use which may be part of the problem   it does smell good  but you need to make sure you give your hair a good tousle so it isn t visible in your hair   as for hold  i don t think it is effective but maybe i m not using enough  ,Negative
 i was so excited when this became available on amazon  it s super affordable and every single brush is fantastic quality    i actually use the foundation brush for concealer on my face and the eyeshadow brush for undereye concealer and the multitask brush for powder  i love love love them all  the multitask brush is super super soft so it can push the powder into the skin and ensures it s not sitting on top of the foundation and have my face looking powdery  i love it and use it every single day  i haven t touched my sigma powder brush since i got this one  when i m cleaning my dresser i can t stop touching them  they are so soft  these brushes are a definite must have  ,Positive
great price   looks good on   stays all day   easy to remove   i would reccommend this product   i have bought the same product in different shades and i love them all,Positive
 i bought this in the timeless color  i think the actual color is closer to a deep nude shade with a subtle hint of coral   it has a softer more natural look than a true coral   i do like the color and it wears well with no feathering into fine lines  i would also say it is a true lip liner and is a bit too dry to use as a fill color  if you re looking for a subtle  softer more natural looking coral  timeless will work well for you  ,Positive
 i m very fair and this was a nice sheer nude color on me  it does have a bit of glitter in it  but nothing ridiculous or too obvious   not enough to bother me  it feels glossy on and pretty moisturizing  great color to pair with smokey eyes  it s a shame revlon discontinued these  i would try other colors  ,Positive
this stuff is horrible  way to sticky  if it gets on your fingers it just has to wear off yuck,Negative
 my daughter just went to her first dental appointment and the doctor advised she stop sucking hey thumb immediately  we have been discouraging her from sucking her thumb for months but although she knows it s bad for her teeth and she doesn t want to do it  comfort prevails and she continued the bad habit  we bought her a book  showed her pictures of crooked teeth from thumb sucking  and tried to put colorful band aids on her thumbs  she liked the bandaid but eventually would pull them off and suck  i would even try to hold her down with her arms away from her face so she would fall asleep without sucking  i was hesitant to try this because i thought it would be cruel but after trying so many things  just decided to go for it  she liked putting the polish on and even asks for more but we only put it on her thumbs because the taste does come off on food and she still sometimes finger feeds   it was funny watching her the first time she tried to suck and hard not to pretend something was different  eventually that day she asked me to wash her fingers off  but we told her it would help her stop  and it did  i found we had to reapply once a day  i tested it on my pinky and it lost its effectiveness by end of day  she is sleeping now without sucking although it does seem harder to put her down because she doesn t have a comfort mechanism now  she asks for story after story     but it has worked  i will continue to apply for another week to make sure she s weaned completely  ,Negative
 so i wanted to try this because i like the derma e hylauronic mask and paula s choice reviews said it would be good for dry skin   we nope it&#34 s not and seems to dry my skin out more and make it feel tight    i don t understand why they would make this under a best review for toners   the igredients may past their test  but the mixture of it shouldn t because it feels like alcohol rub going on my face   this is the only product that s been bad from their reviews   it burns my skin literally everytime i ve used it  but i tolerate it because it s suppose to be &#34 good&#34  for my skin  i don t have sensitive skin i&#34 m more normal to dry   i hate it   and got me paula s toners which don t burn and feel cooling to my dry skin  this is horrible and not a good buy at all    ,Negative
love love love   lashes are longer and fuller   i dread the day i run out of this ,Positive
i rather just put regular eyeprimer under my eyes than this it doesnt do anything for my wrinkles ive been using this till its all gone cuz i dont want to waste my money after its finished i will not be buying again,Negative
 holy mac  i am super pleased with the range of colors available and especially the savings under the subscribe and save program   this product is also great as it is 10 minutes maximum  no dangerous chemicals  no peroxide or ammonia  which means this is not a level 3 graded coloring   the colors are very good and my scape is not left itchy after use and easy to rinse off i am buying this is because it is my preferred brand and now it has become a whole lot easier to buy  before  i had to scout for the weekly discounts in my local drug stores   now for the same savings  all i have to do is press a few buttons   love it  ,Positive
 this mascara is amazing    i have long  blonde eyelashes & this make them look even longer  curls them & makes them look thick all while separating them & really doesn t leave any clumps  i absolutely recommend this mascara if you re not into the clumpy eyelash look  you can use 1 or 2 coats to make them look natural & 3 5 coats to make them look thicker & blacker  love this mascara   &#60 3i used to use the maybelline falsies nascar which is terrible compared to this mascara  you will really love this wand&#8230  ,Positive
 i did see it make some difference in my skin  but after about a week of using it i got very sore  red  flaking areas on my face  so i had to stop using it  which i was sad about  did anyone else get this reaction  ,Negative
 i really like the dove body wash  it is creamy like a lotion and lathers like a body wash should   the smell of the body wash is wonderful and leaves my skin feeling very soft   the only downfall was the small pouf that came with it  it seems extra small  ,Positive
 this powder smells really nice  i like the natural color  i have ivory to light beige skin depending on the season  and it fits nicely  ,Positive
 i like the smell and feel of this  very good moisturizer   it is oily  obviously  so if you don t like that consistency  this is not for you  but it absorbs well and my skin feels great in the morning after having this on overnight  ,Positive
it didn t work as well as i had hoped it would  i had high hopes that it would be a true henna mask for my hair but it seemed to dry it out and make it feel like straw ,Negative
 too bad  because i was so excited to get these in the mail   an hour ago  the handles are caps  which is cool  but i sculpted a few nails to see how they did and the acrylic gets totally stuck in the bristles and the nice fine point they came to is completely gone and doesn t look like it ll return any time soon  it s so frayed i can t get it back into the cap  at least they came in hard plastic tubes that i can use for other brushes  don t bother with these   guess i ll have to spend $40 on a good brush  ,Negative
 i love eco tools but this travel kit is a joke  is more like a kit for a 1 year old babu face  the fue shadow is the only normal one  the concealer one maybe  is small but i guess for details is okay but the kabuki and powder are horrible small  so hard to pick up product and apply it  i don t think its worth the money and i was very disappointed ,Negative
 had to return because i got rash on my face  apparently it was old  but i wish i got to try it better since it did get good reviews ,Negative
 quality is lacking   these they fell apart without even using them  the entire metal tip falls off not a good deal  ,Negative
 purchased this based on other reviews here   followed youtube instructions and also read tips from reviewers here   1st time i tried it  it was so painful had to stop   so purchased numming cream which made it more bearable 2nd time   it just seem to tear up my skin   my acne scar actually became worse   would not recommend this  ,Negative
 it feels very different from the other mineral makeup i have tried   i love that almay doesn t test on animals  and i love their hypo allergenic products  but the coverage is just not wonderful  ,Positive
 love this brush set  i m already using it and they all work great  very soft  and good coverage  i would definitely buy again  ,Positive
i am a professional stylist and i really like strong and reliable products this is a keeeper a lot of pins today are very weak and thin     not these very strong     ,Negative
i was not able to use this product  i can not say for sure if it will work or not   i had to return it for a refund ,Negative
 this has no effect on mosquitos thought it would be a repellentwith a nice smell   i read many times that mineral oil clogs pores and induces pimples and acne which i am prone to  regarding softness   it does make your skin so soft    ,Positive
i will never purchase a mini set of opi again  not what i expected and this pack was even worse ,Negative
 hello all i bought this in order to try something different as opposed to paying $40 for my current tinted moisturizer  i have a dark complexion  halle berry ish   dark but with copper undertones  and this particular item is not for me  it is so much lighter than i am that it looks obvious and odd   ashy looking  it was worth a try but i will stick to josie maran s tinted moisturer  it rocks   ,Negative
i have this in the shade in the nude and it s a great nude shade  it goes on smoothly and looks very nice on  it twists up so no need for sharpening  good product ,Positive
 this product is just a greasy  overpriced sunscreen that has a heavy  unattractive scent  there is no firming  no wrinkle remover  no age spot reducer  just sunscreen  i would not recommend this product  ,Negative
 i read the reviews on the smell of this product and should have listened   i don t know if this product works or not because the smell is like vicks vapor rub   it is truly nasty and strong   so if you don t mind smelling like a medicine cabinet  go for it  otherwise  go with something else   the only good thing i can say about this product is that the spray bottle works good  ,Negative
these things are great and you can t beat the price or quality  glad that i purchased  will definitely do so again ,Positive
 i wear this when i m mostly indoors   i also bought the spf 45 sunscreen spray in this same brand   both are very lightweight  not greasy on my face and don t break me out i have worn this on a day when i was outside for seveal hours and i did get some sun   so i wouldn t recommend this for prolonged sun exposure   i still really enjoy this lotion  but not for days when i m outside for prolonged periods   for that i use a higher spf and reapply my zinc oxide regularly  ,Negative
the name says it all   you  will never be disappointed with this brand  specially this uv top coat  i can make my own gel manicure with any polish ,Negative
 i have always liked ease of use when employing beauty and skin care products  but more than that i prize effectiveness   this generously sized bottle of argan oil  combined with vitamin e  is a great  truly effective product i have very fair skin which gets extremely dry in the winter  so i focused trying argan hair skin & body treatment on my skin it has a slight tint to it  and a light fragrance which reminds me of fruit  i like the fragrance  and the tint disappears when you apply the few pumps required to add the treatment oil to your skin this calms your skin as well as adding the needed moisture  my legs and arms look 100 percent less flaky and dry  as i used my hands to apply this treatment  i love how they look now as well  they haven t looked this good all year  also on the plus side  my hands are not greasy  i am typing this review with no problem  the argan oil absorbs quickly and yet you know that it is doing its job  the bottle states that the treatment offers   intense hydration    and the bottle is very right i plan to use this every day  because it is fast and easy  i can apply it everywhere except the eye area  it to not supposed to get in your eyes   i also applied it on my hair  i like the silky feel of my hair after trying this treatment on my hair a lot round up your products and replace them with this great argan hair skin & body treatment oil  it is the real thing  i am so happy with the results i have received by using this treatment  it is a do not miss  for you if you have dry skin or hair or need to repair your skin which is suffering from effects of eczema or psoriasis  i cannot say if it is the answer to the last two without a doctor s ok  but it really really helps  and it helps visibly instantly     and it continues to help one great product  many uses   love it thanks jean ,Positive
 inexpensive  plentiful  fast shipping    for my various projects  nails  costume  makeup  props  art  decorations    easy transaction  glitters are bright without looking cheesy  ,Positive
i am using my husbands account  i really love this primer  it is great for the price  it makes my foundation looks smotth and flawless  i use it under both my foundation and bb cream  i would recommend this to anyone who wants a great primer at a cheap price  i keep it stocked about 3 bottles at a time ,Positive
the color is good but it does not stay on very long  you will have to re apply it every few days ,Positive
 so i did not notice a major difference in my lash size of length but most importantly this stuff gives you major raccoon eyes   i thought it was me  my facial cream who knows what but after using a much less expensive product without an issues i had to review   the worst part is that it won t easily wipe off when it smears to a upper lid or under the eye   i would never purchase it again and i m not really sure what i will do with the one i have   and yes i wear mascara daily   waste of money  ,Negative
 cons  very sticky  had a bad odor to them  i was very disappointed and ended up getting rid of the entire set  ,Negative
 i love all of the peacock barrettes  but all i wear is silver jewelry  not gold  so i saw this silver barrette and thought the colors were amazing  however  i thought i was getting this exact barrette  and i didn t  the one i did get  though  is already broken   two hours out of the packaging  and i hadn t even worn it of the eleven stone   feathers   shown in the picture  three are pink  two are green  two are light blue  two are dark blue  and two are purple  on the barrette i got  five are pink  two are red  one is light blue     and three are a hideous yellow cheap citrine color  no green  no purple  no dark blue  and one of the yellow ones came off i will keep it  since it cost practically nothing  i ll hot glue the broken   feather   back on  the peacock itself is well formed and the stones seem securely set on that part  also  the piece has a good weight to it that s necessary for my thicker than thick hair  but this matches a lot fewer articles of clothing than i thought it would     i wanted the colors in the picture  oh well  ,Negative
 this works great to hold up short hair   i normally somewhat spike my hair and this holds my hair up as well as gel   the cream feels like lotion  and you don t need a lot to get a good hold for your hair   i use anti dandruff shampoo daily so i can t tell if it is preventing dandruff  but it can t hurt   if you have flakes  and need a gel for your hair  this is the combo for you  ,Positive
 i used this quite often for a few months for at home gel nails  it took forever for the gel to set with this and unfortunately my cat knocked it off of my table and ever since i can t get it to turn on  i changed the bulb but that didn t fix it  i switched to a different brand and have had no issues with gel setting up appropriately  ,Negative
these colors were very transparent and dusty when you try to use your eyeshadow brushes not a huge fan  $12 down the drain ,Positive
 unfortunately  i haven t noticed any visible results with this eye cream  it also leaves a white film crust all around my eyes that i have to carefully clean off every morning which is pretty annoying  it definitely doesn t work under concealer since it balls up pretty badly  overall  a pretty big bummer  ,Negative
 i got this for a gift for my daughter and she loves it  she keeps all of her makeup in it and the colors in the case were really nice and has used a little of everything which is unusual  ,Positive
i was very disappointed when i received this product broken  it looks like it may have made a great mirror but i ll never know ,Negative
creative nail creative nail design nail lacquer   the nail lacquer was horrible   it was very runny and i had to use four coats to get a solid opaque color but even then it streaked  granted it is a very light color but still       if i could give it zero stars i would ,Negative
left my hair feeling like it had a residue on it also it smelled funny   it is not wen and shouldn t even be compared to it,Negative
 i used this for the first time tonight  and i swear some of my blotches from peeling are disappearing after letting the bronzers work for only an hour and a half before showering   on top of that  the lotion consistency was a lot like sinfully black in that it was more liquid than most lotions  but not in a bad way  more like it spreads further because of its viscosity   i can t tell you anything about the smell before or after at the time because i ve been very sick for almost a week now  and now the only thing really left is major congestion   so no sense of smell   =   considering it is an australian gold lotion  however  it probably smells wonderful and would bring me a nostalgic feeling of florida like most tanning lotions  i spent most of my teen years in florida  and then moved away to my undying chagrin    i would definitely recommend this to others  and i really hope the price stays under $23   much higher than that  and i might as well shell out some extra dough for luminary or obsidian by designer skin  >=  ,Negative
 this is one of the best shampoo i have ever used  it is sulfate free and it does not dry out your hair  it makes your hair very soft  i recommend it for everyone that is looking for a good  cheap sulfate free shampoo  ,Positive
 i don t think the optics are very good in the mirror there is some distortion  put it into a vacation rental  i wouldn t use it on a daily  ,Negative
 these smell like rubbing alcohol  and nothing else  it stings slightly as i use the towelette on my face  i am afraid to use these near my eyes to remove my eye makeup  i will not buy again  these wipes leave my skin too dry  and the makeup still seems hard to remove with these wipes i like the neutrogena hydrating towelettes much better  they seem better for sensitive skin  ,Negative
 the smell is pretty awful  the feel is pretty nice  the firmness with use is nothing for me  won t buy again  ,Negative
 fantastic idea and made well  fits in most of my bags and makes grabbing what you need so much quicker  i am currently using in a large mk bag that was basicly a sackful of chaos  now i m not digging for my wallet  that hair tie or keys that are never on the top of the pile  would also work well as a toiltetry bag  ,Negative
 this is a very expensive cheap product   when my mother asked me to look at it becaus of her thinning hair  i was shocked to find both sodium laurel sulfate  sodium laureth sulfate and parabens in this product sles is a cheap surfactant used in engine degreasers and car wash soaps   parabens are cancer causing agents   really   this is a very expensive ripoff  ,Negative
 i am not a very fussy person when it comes to beauty   i don t wear makeup most days  but do want to keep from looking like a char pei on a bad day before i m 60 because of allergies  i ve always been a neutrogena gal  using their healthy skin line for years   i m currently using the anti wrinkle   spf 15 with retinol  which i ve been happy with when the olay prox system became available through the amazon vine program  i really looked forward to testing an expensive anti wrinkle system   when the box arrived  i was ready to throw my cheapo neutrogena tube in the junk drawer and start slathering the high dollar solution on my wrinkled mug  but then i got a thought    why not do a side by side test      literally  the right side of my face would be neutrogena  the left would be the property of ms  olay i started on may 29  right after taking a `before  photo   so nice to take a close up makeup free snap of yourself in bright daylight  such a wonderful way to start the day  but this was for science every day  and night  since i ve faithfully applied the three olay products as directed to the left side of my face and neck  and done my usual neutrogena in the am and nothing at night on the right after a month  there is absolutely no discernible difference between the right and left sides of my face  well  besides the differences that were there already   i have the same amount of wrinkles  the same depth  the same age spots  everything in the interest of science and for +40 ladies everywhere  here are close up views of my wrinkly un made up face for all to see  check comments for this info yes  it is ugly  but for a good cause in conclusion  i did not have any adverse reaction to the olay products   all three felt good on my face  never oily or heavy   if i had seen any results at all  i would be happy to continue using them and paying 4x the cost of the neutrogena healthy skin cream  however  without results  i can t see any reason to spend the extra money just for nicer packaging  ,Negative
i got this product just to have a powder to lightly set my makeup and i got to say it works better than i thought it would even considering i dnt use much of the product whenever i apply it  it s so light but helps get rid of the shine on my face but still leaves a bit of sheen so you know ur skin can breathe with this on and it looks natural and effortless  the other day i was too tired to fuss with makeup so i jus applied concealer under my eyes and buffed this product onto myface and it gave a really nice finish  evened out my skin tone and even in the evening it still felt comfortable on it s own  love this foundation ,Positive
 this is a great blush  i love the packaging  design and colors  it is big and i like how it is three different colors  it goes on smooth and light  ,Positive
this is a great little item that makes my whole mascara applying routine sooo much more easier   for some time i would bend & use a paper matchbook cover and keep it under my bottom lashes whilst applying the mascara  it worked ok but couldn t use it for the upper lashes in any way  so where has this been all my life   thanks so much for this  i love it ,Positive
 i agree with the other two reviewers   the color is deceiving  i m pretty pale   this is more like a bronzer for me  it has pretty remarkable staying power  as well  ,Negative
 i couldn t get it to pump out  so i opened it up and the stem to the pump was broken   i did put some of it on  and it does not cover well  and it settled in pores   overall  yuck  ,Negative
 not as advertised   this is supposed to be a color corrected product and instead it has no color in it   pleasant enough to use  i don t find it is helpful to my skin  just not harmful   clinique makes a better color correcting cc type cream  ,Negative
 i m on my third tube of blinc  after stumbling onto it through american apparel as a contact lens wearer  i love that it doesn t irritate my eyes as a rainy city dweller  and someone who does not really futz with makeup more than once a day   i love that it doesn t get smudgey and leave me with raccoon eyes at the end of a long  sweaty day i haven t had any issues with thinning or falling out lashes  but i have caught myself committing the cardinal blinc sin and absent mindedly tugging the tubes off sans water  i m trying to break myself of that habit  and i bought the &#34 strengthening&#34  and &#34 vitamin enriched&#34  primer for peace of mind  which also makes my lashes look much longer fuller  i never want to go back to  normal  mascara  ,Positive
 even though i am only in my 30s  my skin looked and felt like i was much older  it seemed that no matter what i did i couldn t get rid of the fine lines and wrinkles  i was desperate for something to work  so i figured i would give this product a try  at first  i was skeptical because of the price  but i figured if it worked  it would be well worth it after using it for a month  i can tell a difference  it goes on feeling light and smooth  you don t have to worry about any greasy film being left on your skin after applying it  the smell isn t pungent like some of the other ones on the market  which is nice  it s simple to use and works wonders  i highly recommend this product to anyone who wants to erase the hands of time and restore their appearance  a true miracle worker  ,Positive
 i have sensitive  acne prone skin  so i decided to give this a try  i bought it at the store  not amazon  i also just checked the box  and it is this specific one  not the antibacterial one  oh  and the box it came in is a week old  we recycle  and still reeks of this soap  i don t know how people are saying that it has no smell because this scent is so overpowering that i smell it for hours in the bathroom after a shower and on my hairline  i just ordered some reviva bar soaps  hoping that they are also non drying and don t smell too strongly  i ve been using dove bar soap for awhile and it smells wonderful  but it is too drying on my face  ,Negative
i used this cream and did not see any changes in my skin at all  waste of money and time ,Negative
using this shampoo and conditioner combo made my hair extremely dry and tangled  i have seen cheaper brands like suave perform way better than this one  do not recommend this product,Negative
 i don t know if it is the make of the product or the scent  but it makes my hair dry like a broom  i thought it was just me  so my husband used it and his hair was dry like straw too  ,Negative
 my daughter has hair similar to mine  thick  course  frizzy  with wave   i control mine by flat iron or curling iron but my 5 year old doesn t have the patience to have her hair done before school   i was hoping that motions naturally you define my curls would help tame her hair in the morning   the product has a strong perfume scent  which my daughter was fine with   our biggest problem is that it made her hair really greasy looking  even with just a tiny amount on my hands   yes  the frizz was gone but it looked like a greasy mess   it didn t help define her wave curls at all   lastly  the front label mentions shea butter  coconut and avocado oils  but ingredients are listed last which means they are in the smallest quantities  way behind one of the top ingredients mineral oil   still looking for the right product  ,Negative
 i m a long time user of humectress  my experience was great from the 80 s till a couple years ago  i noticed  like some others  the formula changed  it smelled a bit different but mostly it didn t seem to work as well with the current formulation my hair feels heavy and kind of dead after use  when applying the product in the shower after shampooing it used to make my shower comb slide right through my hair  now my hair is tangle city and i have to work hard to get through after conditioning  i also need to use much more product to get anything close to good conditioning i m sad to say humectress is leaving my list of preferred hair products and i m trying new products to find a replacement update  dec 24  2013 i have begun usingbiolage fortetherapie strengthening conditioner by matrixand i m doing very well with this  i still prefer the original salon formula humectress if i can ever get it again  ,Negative
 bought this because of all the good reviews and i needed some help with my bad cuticles  i stuck with it for a while and really gave the oil a chance  but it just did nothing for me it does have a nice smell though  ,Negative
 i expected this styling product to wow me but it did not  this leave in non fragrant foam is for fine  flat hair  my hair is fine and long and is flat to wavy but will curl on its own if left to air dry or in rainy weather since my hair is long  i applied 3 pumps   instead of the 1 2 pumps recommended  of the product to my hair focusing more on my ends  i then blow dried my hair and it came out dry and straggly with not much hold the dove hair styling oxygen moisture leave in foam container says it delicately moisturizes and gives a light hold   i got the light hold but the moisturizing component seems to be missing  this is not a product for me  ,Negative
this cologne smells like dust do not waste your money on this cologne smells like something very cheaap do not waste your time ore your money,Negative
 i find it difficult to find cotton rounds that do not break apart as i am using them  or do not deposit lint everywhere well  these are an excellent choice of rounds that will not break apart as you use them if you want an even higher quality  no lint at all  then check out  delon pure performance i am totally happy with both these brands and will nit have to look any further   i use them to out toner on my face so i need the good quality  ,Positive
 i had an oily perfume that its not in spray  i already had one bottle like this one that i got from avon  with avon perfume  few years ago and tough it was a good idea  but it leaks   ps  the avon bottle never leaked  had it for quite few years  ,Negative
 i love this  i tried it above my lips where tiny wrinkles are starting and they disappeared from view  it actually fills the wrinkles  my red nose with huge pores turns my skin color too  within a few seconds  i don t put my foundation over it since it s not needed  it seems like a moisturizer with lots of talc and it dries fast  you pat it on instead of rubbing it in  it s expensive but i ll continue buying more before it s gone because i never want to be without it  ,Negative
 i bought these specifically to avoid &#34 raccoon eyes &#34  and after just two uses i looked like i was some comedic movie character who fell asleep on the beach and someone played a prank on me  it was seriously so obvious and embarrassing i had to tan a few more times without goggles  which i never do  just to even things out a little bit  i did myself a big favor and ended up buying the wink ease sticker goggles  which are amaaaaaazing   although they can be slightly prices since you only get 3 6 uses out of each pair before the sticky properties wear off  ,Negative
this works well with the weekly cnd nail polished  it works well alone too ,Positive
 did you ever watch   everybody loves raymond     there s a bedtime episode in which patricia heaton applies hand cream right before lights out   it s one of her little special treats   i thought it was cute  and i got it  because i like to use a nice hand cream before bed  too i use it on my hands and feet at night   don t forget to take care of your feet   a little goes a long way   in my opinion  it is not fast absorbing  but it does absorb   i actually like that it takes a couple minutes for it to soak into my skin   it gives me enough time to make sure i get it rubbed into my cuticles yes  after a couple of weeks i did notice a bit of difference in the texture of my skin  but as is true with any effective moisturizer  that only lasts if i keep with it   fortunately  this is a convenient size and quite affordable   neutrogena has hits and misses   this is a hit  ,Positive
 these are the worst brushes i have ever used  they smell and they re like a old rug  only gave 2 stars because there two things i use  the brow brush and angled brush  ,Negative
 idk why people like this  but personally i don t  i like how cheap it is but the quality is horrible  it s rough so it doesn t flow nicely when you try to straighten your hair  i have to buy another one so basically i wasted money  don t waste your money  just spend a little more and buy another straightener worth your money  ,Negative
this brush works well  it s the best brush i ve used at blending eyeshadow and does not shed  i would repurchase ,Positive
 i used this product after using the pudding product of the same brand  while it did provide shine  it did not help with my curls  i am not african american and i believe that this brand of hair products is geared towards african american women  it feels and acts like vaseline and so a little bit goes a long way  my hair is gray  coarse and very wavy  i don t think i ll try this defining cream again  ,Negative
 the shampoo leaves my hair dryeven when i used the conditioner  when i dried it  it was frizzy and the volume was overdone  ,Negative
 this conditioner doesn t seem like anything special going in or rinising out  but it really did a great job with my hair  after just one use  it was shinier and way less fluffy and frizzy  i have a really bad haircut i m trying to grow out  so i m especially sensitive to my hair looking poufy or frizzy  and this has made a huge difference in my ability to tolerate this awful cut  i ve been using it every 2 3 washes  and i wash my hair once or twice a week and use either no product or a light oil in it  i have short  very slightly wavy hair that i wear straight  before i started using this  it went out every which way with the   textured   cut  but now i can manage to get it more or less how i want it with just some wetting and smoothing  and a few drops of light oil if i want some extra gloss  light scent  and the container makes controlling the flow of product easy  ,Positive
this product does everything i need it to do   the only problem i have with it is that it feel cheap and uncomfortable to grip  it is all metal with no rubber for gripping ,Negative
 i really wanted to like this product  according to all the great reviews  it must work on a lot of people with combination or oily skin  it s marketed for   oily  impure   skin  so  i gave this a try  along with the normalizing toner  but it made me breakout the first time i used it  however  being an optimist  and since i spent so much on it and read the rave reviews  i thought maybe i should be patient  to see if my skin was just clearing out and adjusting to it  nope  after over a month of use and repeated breakouts  i tossed both products in the garbage  i also wasn t too keen on the strong herbal botanical scents both this oil and the toner have  ,Negative
 i often don t have time to do makeup  so this is awesome to have you can just put it in your bag doesn t take up that much room and it is neutral colors     love it    ,Positive
 i received this flat iron as a gift from my big bro  extremely happy with it  very smooth and gentle on my hair  ,Positive
i did not care for these at all   i use cosmetic wedges every day but these are made of something different and they had a weird smell   in the trash they went ,Negative
 ok  i love this eyeshadow primer  works really good   i love how it feels  helps to prevent creases and eyeshadow to stay on all day   i love this color   i have brown eyes and find that this color works well for me  ,Positive
 i was so excited the day this product arrived  i figured since it was all natural and had great products it would wonderful for my skin  i m a big fan of taking care of ones skin  so i was taking a shower and figured let me use it and see what it can do as i had tried the honey and rose toner face wash and it was pretty good so as i put the product on my skin felt a little irritated but i figured this was the   gentle exfoliation   that was mentioned  it s a week later and my skin around my cheek bones is red and blistered up the rest of my face is red  irritated and dry with skin flaking off regularly  i have tried multiple treatments to reduce or eliminate the redness and irritation but so far nothing has worked i really wish amazon would make it possible to email the seller or maker of some of these products to give them a piece of my mind it s really unfortunate and i feel quite depressed walking around with everyone staring at my face like i have some really bad sunburn if anyone is reading this and in the same situation  let us pray for each other if you reading this and have a solution that i could try for the dry redness and blistering irritation on my skin please let me know  i would really appreciate it i will never purchase this product again nor recommend it  ,Positive
 this product is excelent for mixed face maskand others powers is not to big but is easy touse    the plastic is soft and have beautiful colorcome on time and in perfect shape ,Positive
it s very small and the shadows aren t that great   lots of fallout and the colors don t stand out   they come off too easily   the lipgloss is alright ,Positive
 this does not work good in my thin  waist length hair     made a pony and put in and it slide out and got tangled   it s just cheap plastic with poor grip   very disappointed   ,Negative
 i love this product  better to use at night because of its oily compound  rids wrinkles at best  i am a jamaican and the product works really well for my skin  ,Positive
 i wanted to try coal eyeliner  but this created so much fallout  that i really wasn t able to use it   perhaps there is a method that i m not aware of to make it work  but i went back to my gel liner after a few tries with this new liner    ,Negative
i accidentally ordered this confusing it for the organix coconut milk  i did not like this  it made my hair feel dry and i didn t see much shine  my daughter loved it however and used it every morning after she beach waved her hair ,Negative
 it does work well when it works  it did fine for about two weeks until it needed to be charged and now it won t stay on for the full one minute  when it worked  my skin was soft and clean and i saw a noticeable difference  i m definitely going to buy something similar from a more trustworthy brand  ,Positive
 i have combination  acne prone skin  and i have tried many cleansers  irrespective of the price   this is my favorite   it cleans thoroughly  doesn t leave any residue  and doesn t dry out my skin   the fact that it is inexpensive is a pleasant bonus   i will continue to buy and highly recommend it  ,Positive
 i have used simple s wipes for sensitive skin since they first came out and loved them  they do a great job of getting off all of my make up when i am too lazy to wash my face   i use these new wipes daily now and so far  they seem to be helping to lighten the few dark spots i have   since i use a silicone base with my make up  it is next to impossible to get off with just my cleanser and this is a great first step to get rid of the base   i haven t noticed any issues with my sensitive skin and i turn red when anything doesn t agree with me   also  the scent is fresh and not overwhelming  ,Positive
i like how it gives you a bit of a tingle and seems to stay on a little longer than ordinary lip balm  comes with clear gloss on other end and is nice on top of this for a more natural color  or lack of color  ,Positive
 somehow this face cream worsened my acne  i even stuck it out  finishing the entire tube  thinking my face was just adjusting and might come out better in the end  what a waste and a disappointment  ,Negative
 i was very glad buying the product after reading the great reviews  had the right combination of ingrediaents too  however  the cream was open when it arrived  also thi shas no list of directions  i really doubt if the product is genuine  i did end up using it and it made absolutely no difference to my skin whatsoever  dont waste your money on this  ,Negative
good buy for a young girl just starting out with makeup   gave them as a christmas gift and all i heard was ooooh aaaaah ,Negative
 for the past couple summers  i have been usingcoppertone sport spf 30 continuous spray clear twin pack  6 ounce cansin an aerosol spray bottle because i wanted to apply the sunscreen without having to use my hands   but i m trying to use products that are in recyclable packaging so i wanted to try this sunscreen first off  it smells good but says it is fragrance free  so it must be the scent of the ingredients   i am very sensitive to perfumes and always appreciate products with no added perfumes   next  it looks a little funky in the bottle with green swirls but just ignore that   it goes on white and absorbs without any green showing it leaves my skin feeling very soft and doesn t have the sticky feeling that sunscreen often gets   i like this product a lot   i still prefer spraying my sunscreen  but this container is recyclable  you have to pull the cap off to see the recycling code  so that outweighs my preference for spraying unfortunately i can t review how well it works as a sunscreen   i have skin that tan very easily and went out in the sun for a lot of little times when i thought i didn t need sunscreen until my skin is quite tan   however  i have been using this when i am intending to be in the sun for long periods while out training for a half marathon and don t see any redness when i get back so i assume it is doing its job one more thing  if you are exercising in the sun heat and sweating up a storm  you will get a lotion sweat slick   i think that is the case no matter what kind of sunscreen you use  ,Negative
 i had one magnetic laquer before and liked it a lot  so wanted to try more  but this ones are not good  cause they don t really reflect the magnetic shape and colors look cheap  ,Negative
 i was really looking forward to the benefits of this soap from all of the positive reviews  so  i ordered 2 lbs  the first time i used it my face instantly burned so bad i had to get it off my skin  after the first time i tolerated it much better  but  i soon had much worse acne and pimples on my face  and for the first time in my life i had acne on my back   and it was severe  with some research i think i understand why this happened  first the ash in the product really strips your skins natural layer  and then it gets covered with a film of palm oil which clogs the pores  this palm oil created a waxy like film on my back and this is what brought on my back acne i also tried using it to wash my hair but initially it stripped my hair so bad that it was like straw  but then before 24 hours was up my hair was oily looking from the film of palm oil it had left in my hair  that is not normal for me  i never tried it again on my hair as that was a disaster i quit using the soap on my face and back and within 2 days i was having a dramatic improvement in my skin  no more clogging the pores with palm oil  no more changing the ph balance with ash  and my skin is improving i will gradually turn all of these 2 pounds of soap into liquid soap and use as a hand soap for use after working in the garden  and when it is used up i will never order this stuff again  ,Negative
 i would not recommend this product   each time i used it  it started burning way too quickly  yes my scalp was greased up first    my hair never came out as straight as it does with other products and the sub par results it does give  does not last long  typically i only relax my hair every 6 8 weeks   i had to get a touch up in 4 weeks using this brand  ,Negative
 while this product calls itself   ultra shea   and also notes   with shea butter   on the front label  shea is actually the 7th ingredient  after mineral oil  #1   hydrogenated coconut oil  hence the suntan lotion smell   hydrogenated styrene butadiene copolymer  elaeis guineensis  palm  oil  and bht  preservative   so if you re expecting some yummy natural product from the   ultra shea   reference  you ll be disappointed  in this case   ultra   either means   a little bit   or   mostly petrochemical products but also    notably  the ingredients aren t immediately visible on the bottle  you have to remove the peel off label to expose them  but i m not opposed to synthetic beauty products  so aside from the misleading packaging  i gave it a whirl  it s a pretty standard hair oil  greasy and thick  which is good for heavy damage or use on ends  i d probably avoid using it on my scalp except as a deep treatment to be shampooed out  because the oil is quite heavy but the scent is a deal breaker for me  it s a *heavy* coconut smell that doesn t readily dissipate and leaves you smelling like you should be on a carnival cruise ship   i love a light coconut scent  especially tempered with citrus  or mint  but this smells like you re all buttered up in a deck chair swilling a pina colada  i do like the bottle  which has an elmer s glue type lid that lets you dispense a few drops at a time  and seems to be pretty leak resistant  ,Negative
the black is a true black and not an off black which was nice to find out   it is a strong polish that does not chip easily   i would buy more colors of this when i need them and they work great with the konad and other brands of design plates of nail art ,Positive
 i ve used several different protein powders over the years  and for me  taste and texture are key  designer whey fit & trim doesn t meet either of those criteria as well as i d like the taste is just okay  when mixed with water or milk  it has kind of a sweet  vanilla flavor  but it wasn t good enough that i wanted to drink it by itself  it s better when you add fruit  cocoa powder  or instant coffee to it  and the texture is pretty grainy another thing to note is that while it is designer whey protein with soy  the soy protein is actually the first ingredient  i d prefer it with only whey protein while it has 15 grams of protein per serving  that s actually much less than some other brands  body fortress  my personal favorite  has 26 grams  for those reasons  i can t recommend this protein powder  ,Negative
 i did not like how slimy my hands and feet felt after using the gloves and socks   a friend used the other pair and liked how her hands and feet felt   i think it was a personal feel  as i don t really suffer from dry skin   i would not reccomend this product  ,Negative
 these are going to look wonderful on my nails   very  very small  but perfect for my small nails   i love this selection and it is unique to others i have seen   plus the price is amazing  ,Positive
 i actually enjoy the soothing noise from the hair dryer but it doesn t seem to dry very fast   it took a long time and i found it difficult at times to keep on  it seems like it wanted to blow right off my head and i had to hold the top part and usually end up giving up and grabbing the hand held hair dryer to hurry up ,Positive
reviews are so great for this ag recoil i got this cuz ppl said it was good on natural curly hair like mine and to my surprise i did not like at all had a lot of stringy pieces in my hair and left it more of a wavy not as curly ,Negative
 i was very disappointed with this brush  i have thin  shoulder length hair but a lot of it  since i have a lot of layers  i was excited to use a brush that would help cut down on drying time  first impressions were that this brush felt very &#34 light&#34   i get the idea of not wanting a brush that is too heavy  but this brush feels very cheap and flimsy  i also did not like the quality of the synthetic bristles  they were very hard and even the ones that were supposed to be softer  were still hard and &#34 pokey&#34   i liked that the middle of the actual brush was open so that heat could flow through the brush and to more of my hair easily  when i attempted to dry my hair with a blow dryer and this brush  i noticed right away that my towel dried hair was getting stuck in the brush  it yanked and pulled  with such little effort  that i had to continually stop drying and use both hands to get the brush out  i regularly use conditioning products to smooth and silken my hair as well as comb through my hair in the shower  so there was no reason that the brush should have gotten stuck like that  i thought that maybe it was because my hair was partly air towel dried so i attempted to use the brush when my hair was very wet  which i dislike doing because putting heat on soaking wet hair can t be good for it  and when my hair was almost dry  again  i dislike doing this because then i lose any volume style i might be able to create   and there were no changes  this brush got stuck every time  i can not speak to how well this brush speeds up drying time or how much volume it adds since i could not use it without stopping to untangle my hair constantly  i do not recommend this brush for any reason  especially not for the purposes listed  ,Negative
i really wanted this product to use on the little tags on the sides of my fingers that when ripped to far become a pain in the buttocks  they relieved the pain and with the addition of the cuticle pusher and scraper made my whole nail area look so much nicer  i found to that after receiving this product that other family members had the want to use it as well which must say something ,Negative
 i like these liners  i only use like 2 of them currently but as an african american woman this has a lot of color so i can fill in the brown outline i naturally have  its also good way to tint your lip gloss ,Positive
 well this lotion is definitively the worst i have ever tried in my life i attempted 3 times to apply it on my skin and each time after about 20 minutes it started causing a terrible redness and burning in the eyes  i had not put it around the eyes though   this is certainly limited to my own skin  so this reaction should be taken as a rare exception  the weird thing is that i tried probably hundreds of lotions of any types in my life  even some very cheap made in china ones  and this is the very fist that causes me such a reaction  not sure which ingredient is responsible for that  or maybe the product was very old  i bought it on ebay from an overstock seller  it is also very oily  it does not look like it absorbs well and you might find your pillow oily too if you apply it just before bed  ,Negative
 i like the range of colors offered but the formula is just too stiff   if this was a bit creamier  i could load it to my brush and apply easier  ,Negative
 don t know why i continue to spend $$$ on more expensive products when pantene is available  this conditioner left my wet hair without tangles  and feeling soft without being weighed down or greasy when dry   the brightening agents did not leave me in fear of having &#34 blue hair&#34   but did bring out the sparkle and shine i was hoping for   also smells great  highly recommended  ,Positive
this will be my second time ordering and i really love him natural when you put them onso if you d like to looknatural when you worry i would definitely recommend this to youlove it,Positive
very disappointed in this product  we used as directed on the bottle & found it to be very sticky & hairs stick together like it s wet  not the look i was hoping for ,Negative
 yes   this is a great deal for the proactiv solution kit which includes the 3 steps   the cleanser is step 1  toner is step 2  and repairing treatment lotion is step 3   i have been using this kit for several years and can t go without this product   i occasionally have acne breakout  but it is much milder acne because i use proactiv   i do run out of product and that is when i have break outs   i usually buy each proactiv step separately  because step 2 and step 3 last longer than step 1 does   if i find a great deal on whole 3pc kit  i will opt for the kit   amazon has great deals and prices  just be sure to check the shipping charges as well   i would definitely recommend this product and be sure to check for expiration dates  especially for step 1  ,Positive
ive used better pens  to me it wasnt really worth the price but maybe its just the remover it came with  the tip is pretty hard and its like u scrape the paint away on your fingers which u could go with a cuticle pusher ,Negative
 i was so hoping this product would work as well as most of the john frieda products do   however  sadly it is not up to par   in order for the ends of my hair to stay glossy i would need to reapply ever 30 minutes or even sooner   also  i did notice that my hair became brittle after using this product   i m sad to say i will be returning this   on a positive note the item arrived very quickly  ,Negative
i ve gone natural i have 4c hair  this seems to work pretty well in my hair  i haven t tried any other leave in conditioner at this point since this one seems to be working ,Negative
 the picture shows black with no other color options available to choose from  that i saw   when it arrived  it was bent and was unpackaged in a 3 x 3 envelope with no instructions  and was bright purple   how do you hide that      change my hair color to purple  i guess   anyway  i sent it off to good will  ,Negative
i found this did not absorb into my skin as well as some of the other serums i ve tried   i didn t see any benefit from using it unfortunately   will not buy this again ,Negative
 i have thick  very curly hair that i style naturally   just finger combing and i m completely good with that   this style works for all seasons  especially during the summer when i am in and out of the ocean and or pool a lot  i do not flatiron  straighten  or blow dry my hair    i followed the directions on the can  and it all worked until i got to #3   which is &#34 brush through your hair &#34  i don t ever brush my hair because that removes all the individual curls but leaves a lot of volume  i did brush it this time to use this product and it left me looking like a very unkempt lioness who had been scared by something really frightening   this product may be good for people with straight hair or people with curly hair who try to have straight hair   although i also did not like the &#34 feel&#34  of my hair after using it   i can not recommend it for those who wish to use it and still maintain their natural curls  ,Negative
 price is good  but this is a no go for those of us with good skin who don t want a heavy powder  very heavy coverage  even when applied with a brush because it contains talc  will go right into the garbage where it belongs  ,Negative
 for a make up novice  this stuff is great  it goes on smoothly and easily   doesn t have that scratchy pencil consistency  it even comes with a sharpener  the only downside is that the creamyness wears off  luckily  after sharpening  or if it breaks  the liner resumes its nice and easy application  it also helps to sharpen it if you like a nice thin line  i think almost anyone can successfully use this liner  ,Positive
 this primer is awful  i expected so much from nyx with this primer  but i was disappointed the formula is chalky white and streaky when applied  it is not smooth or easy to apply foundation over i do like the packaging and pump  but hate the actual primer  i do not use this at all try the photo perfecting primer from nyx instead  its much better  ,Negative
 the mist size on this spray is adjustable  and i can get a perfect fine mist with this  water sprays out evenly  and it works perfectly for hair styling or hair cutting purposes  highly recommended  this size bottle is a bit small  and i would recommend it for personal use rather than for client use  ,Positive
 i believe covergirl had a ton of black mascara left over and needed to market it quickly  that s good for them  but bad for us  i used it three separate times for the purposes of digging out the issues for you  the fluid   the product   itself seems to be great  it stays on during the day and washes off with soap  it is not waterproof  but it doesn t claim to be   the problem  the applicator is atrocious  if you like clumps on your lashes  buy this  there is no way to drag those clumps off without some of them going on your eyelashes  l oreal voluminous waterproof is still the best  i often try new ones for kicks  but this one is a 100% no go because of the applicator  i hope this helps you choose  ,Positive
 these cannot be for human hands     i have 60 grit sandpaper which is less coarse   these are so coarse they tear up your nails  and they are the same grit on both sides  while being advertised as being different  ,Negative
 after reading reviews and doing my own experimenting  this is what i ve learned **shake the bottle before use**skin must be clean and oil free**if skin puckers  dab gently with wet fingertip**mixing with foundation will reduce the effectivenessas far as flaking is concerned  i haven t noticed any  although my daughter said it flaked a little when she tried it   i really need to wear foundation  due to pigmentation issues  and so i will continue to experiment  ,Positive
this is such good stuff  all organic and so creamy  i use this for my conditioner cleansing  no shampoo for me    it leaves my hair so nicely conditioned  my hair has that nice heavy hang from all the moisturizing ingredients  great 1st step in my hair routine  have used this for 2 years with great results  great to detangle my curly hair with   nice slip can also be bought at lakshmi s cupboard online store for $4 40  ships same or next day ,Positive
 my bad  i read the reviews and purchsed on linefirst  without knowing the scent    thank goodness i got the add on  and not the prime tri pack   first  i m not a tresemme user  so i have no idea what their other products smell like   maybe this is similar   considering the ratings  i m probably in the minority where my brain just doesn t comprehend the scent the overall smell to me is similar to waking up after a frat party and smelling a cup with cheap stale beer   i personally don t consider this &#34 citris&#34  but it does have a sharp  pungent smell   as i get closer  i can hone in on the floral type scent  but i just feel the chemical aroma over powers all together   i m so sad    i was really hopeful   i ll see if any of my other friends have a different sense of smell  as i ll be happy to give this away  ,Negative
 biotin did great things for my hair  i used it for two weeks  and almost immediately i could see the difference in my hair  it looks healthier and thicker   after two weeks of taking one capsule daily  i started having really bad acne   my skin was really clear before i started using this product  so i am discontinuing my use of it   it s a great product if you don t end up with huge pimples all over your face  ,Positive
 i am so shocked to read that so many people have had the same problem with this product as me  i thought it was an isolated incident  i too used it for 2 3 uses and then poof the can was suddenly empty  there is definately some sort of defect with this product  ,Negative
 the first thing that surprised me about this is the drying effect   the color gave my skin a chalky color and didn t easily cover evenly   i didn t see where it does anything that it claims to   it is drying instead of hydrating and there was no brightening or anti aging effects   it couldn t substitute for foundation because it doesn t even skin tones and can t be used near the eyes   i didn t realize that until i read the warnings   it also can t be used on damaged or broken skin   for sun protection it says use a water resistant sunscreen if swimming or sweating and says to reapply it every two hours   my dermatologist recommends me to use good sunscreen because of a medication that i take makes my skin more sensitive to the sun  but this is more trouble than it is worth to me   it is easier to just put on makeup with a regular sunscreen   i would not recommend this  ,Negative
 i guess this product is exactly what was advertised  but still not what i expected  it is a very viscous oil  and wil make your hair greasy and slimey when you apply it  it is recommended that you leave it in your hair overnight  but don t do this unless you want your pillowcase to look like the bottom of a french fry basket this oil does not smell anything like coconut  my kids think i smell like rotten pickles when i use it  i think it smells more like an asian seafood marinade  regardless  it s not a look or smell you will find desirable it congeals to a solid between uses  and has to be heated to turn it back into a liquid  not interolerable  but inconvenient as for the effect on my hair  i can t say as i have noticed a significant difference  i have been using regularly for about 2 weeks  and while i have no particular complaints about my hair  neither have i noticed any difference in it  i have to believe that i can get similar or greater benefits from other hair oils with less of these unpleasant other qualities  ,Negative
great product  does what it is supposed to  fades my scars  notice changes every week i use it  i strongly reccomend this if your complexion needs help ,Positive
 i tried this product recently being that my normal product  clearasil maximum strength acne treatment cream  tinted   1 oz  was out of stock at my local drug store  this product is just as effective as clearasil  but i found the texture to not be as smooth as clearasil and therefore did not absorb evenly and fully into the skin when applied  my primary complaint is that when you are 1 2 a tube down it basically shoots out when you try to dispense a dab to your fingertip  with clearasil that was never a problem  many teenagers are trying this product since they are heavily promoting it  i gave a tube to my teenage son and he has yet to see a pimple since starting daily use  he applies a very thin layer to his entire face daily and this seems to be very effective  prior to using acne treatment creams he would have occassional flare ups around his nose and lips but those are now gone  i have had adult acne off and on my entire adulthood  but with the use of tea tree oil  moisturizer  and either clearasil or this my face now stays clear 99% of the time  if you are an adult acne sufferer i would recommend you tryclearasil adult care acne treatment cream  tinted 0 65 oz  2 packsinstead because it has a different medicine formulated just for adults  ,Negative
 i order this for my daughter and i know it took an long time to come but when i gotten it  it was broken  when i contacted seller they asked me to take a picture to send another one but i didn t just cuz i knew how long it takes to come  ,Negative
 i was not immediately sold on wen  but with a little playing around to see what worked best for my type of hair  i grew to love it  in fact  i am on my second super size bottle of the lavender  having fine curly hair  i really needed something to moisturize and volumize  and this product works for me  i do not use as much as the bottle says to use  nor do i   wash   twice  i simply make sure my hair is soaked  then i slather a good handful or 2 all over  massaging scalp  and all the way to the ends  then add a little more water  use a wide tooth comb to comb thru and leave it while finishing the shower  then i rinse my head last  before i get out  i put a little pump full into my wet hair as a leave in i also am hooked on deva curl products  so i may vary this routine by using the deva one conditioner instead or before the wen  if i am really dry  also i use the deva gel which combined with wen really gives me full and defined curls  after using wen for months now  my hair looks healthier  it is not breaking hardly at all  granted  i am not combing it either except during said shower  if you have baby fine curls i think you might like this  as i do  it smells great  no animal testing  and even though it is a bit pricey  it seems to last  i truly love it  ,Positive
 if your looking for a full coverage  this is not for you   its light maybe medium and that s a big maybe    super watery   not my favorite  and not for the price ,Negative
 suave kids 2 in 1 shampoo and conditioner cowabunga coconut   this is good shampoo conditioner  but it can leave hair dry   but i will not deduct a star for that  because it probably depends on the type of hair you have   since this product is clearly labeled as   kids    then if an adult uses it  it might or ir might not be   perfect   for them   but even if it is not   perfect    it is next to perfect  because it does get the hair clean  and the smell is good   if it does indeed leave your hair a little dry  then i guess you just need to condition it a little more to make up for it but for kids  hair  it is   perfect     highly recommended for   kids   great product and great  trusted name brand   and great smell  ,Positive
 im not a big fan of the tangle teaser  but i like it   it s hard to detangle a tiny part without having the brush to catch on another part that im detangling  i usually see more hair on the tangle teaser than on my wide tooth comb  ,Negative
 now these are worth my money  they have a nice well  line to fit your nail up to  on them  the right sized u shape seems to fit so nicely on my nails  they are not too thick or thin  once the acrylic is over the nail and tip they are perfect something i never actually thought i would write  but i recommend these tips  i wish i would have found these years ago  ,Positive
 i think there are better ways of puffing the hair  like a very cheap kind of sponge thar has a velcro on it  but it s an ok product  ,Negative
 i thought it would take forever to straighten my thick and wavy hair with this narrow flat iron but i was wrong  it was went quickly  the iron heats up quickly and gives a nice hot press  the end results is shiny  flat  non  frizzy hair that lasts all day if it is dry and most of the day if it is rainy or humid there are videos on youtube teaching curling with a flat iron techniques how to curl my hair with this flat iron  which worked well  i have tried it before with a wider iron and got so so results with this iron i got very good results i m still practicing but the iron does a good job and it looks like i am replacing my older wider flat iron and my curling iron with this  ,Positive
the polish came on time in the mail it is beautiful on your nails  i recommend this polish to everybody i love china glaze product,Positive
 i first tried this sunscreen on a sunny day when i was outside for maybe two hours  i didn t get a sunburn  so i figured it worked fine  compared to cream based sunscreens  i really like the aerosol style  it s much easier to apply this spray to hairy arms and legs than a lotion is    no endless rubbing with this stuff however  the second time i used this stuff i was outside for most of the day  my wife and i applied it once near the beginning of our outing and we were both showing signs of sunburn after three hours  we reapplied the sunscreen at that time  but the damage was done  i don t want to think about reapplying the sunscreen that often  so i think we ll stick with the cream  the spray on stuff would be great if it actually works  but i d rather avoid a sunburn than avoid spending a minute rubbing the cream into my skin  ,Negative
 being a makeup artist i am always willing to try other things  i usually by my concealer camouflage from another well known company  so i thought since this looked like the same product & it was alot cheaper  id s give it a try  well the quality is not the same  the coverage isnt that great  it is somewhat oily  you d think that would be ok since i have dry skin but no  it doesn t work well at all  i still like my concealers to have a matte finish  this does not  every color had pink undertones  i thought that the green or yellow pots would be great to mix with the other colors or help with skin conditions on my clients but that doesn t work either  the green shows off a oily light whitish green  even the darker colors have pink or red undertones  luckily i have so many foundation colors with different  undertones  i can use a foundation with a green undertone to neutralize the pink in this concealer  i will just go back to my original company and order their concealer camouflage  ,Negative
 i m very fair skinned and this turned orange the minute i applied it   i will never be able to wear this   i m bummed that i wasted the money   if you are really fair  i would try another brand  ,Negative
 it makes you feel like a film is covering your hair  you really have to rinse this stuff out  my hair didn t feel clean or healthier either ,Negative
 i have certain perfumes for certain occasions  this i use before working out or when i m feeling sporty in general  smells &#34 eh&#34  in the bottle but smells damn delicious on the body  a classic  clean scent  ,Positive
 the   damage reducing conditioning plates are infused with avocado and conditioners that prevent moisture loss and cuticle damage   may be a gimmick but i was pleasantly surprised to find this iron to works better  straighter hair faster  than my current iron  my hair felt much  much hotter to the touch  i nearly burnt myself when touching my hair after straightening  but the hair needed fewer passes through to become straight  i will be interested to see if the   avocado and conditioners   wear off the iron over time  ,Positive
 this is the best brush ever  it s small and very dense and soft  i applies foundation beautifully  if you want that very smooth  thing layers that look almost airbrushed  this is small and i do believe there is a large version  small takes more times but means it works on the nose and around the eyes  it is very dense so foundation blends beautifully  i use it with laura mercier silk cream foundation and bb creams and it does an amazing job  the beauty blender is faster and soft on the skin   this looks even better  as you can really blend   you can use it for any cream or liquid product  i use it to apply powdered blush sometimes as it s small and i like to apply blush on a small area  as i have redness near the nose  so i don t want anything pinky even close to that area  so i can bland in small area with this  it is very well made  it feels so soft against the skin yet the very firm  it s a super dense brush and fairly stiff   this is a really well made brush  ,Positive
 i received this pretty fast which was the only plus  i plugged it in  turned it on  it came on for about 1 66587455 seconds and then shut off          hasn t worked since  waste of money and time  i will just invest on a better quality drill for a little bit more money  period  ,Negative
 the product is of a very cheap quality and quite a few of the shapes are mis shaped  they adhere fine to nails  but turn dull when top coat is applied  the gems were really cheap   and i guess  well  you get what you pay for      ,Negative
 i am an olay fan but thought it would be nice to try this brand   i have heard a lot about it on beauty blogs so i thought i would give it a go   let me say first off that this is labeled as a cream   it is not a cream  not my definition of a cream anyway    it is more like a gel   it is very sticky going on and it doesn t get absorbed into your skin   twenty minutes after applying my skin still felt like i had applied glue  and i used a moderate amount    i had to take a dry wash cloth and wipe my face because i was afraid my face would stick to my pillow as i fell asleep i also didn t care for the fragrance   it isn t overpowering but it isn t something that made me think   mmmmm  this smells good     the odor that came to mind for some reason was the soap in airplane lavatories water is the first ingredient listed and glycerin is the second listed   so  i am not surprised at that considering the consistency of the product   i don t think this product moisturizes   it acts more like a pore blocking protectant of some kind i understand some people might like this product but i just can t get on board   i will stick with the olay creams that don t break out my skin  ,Negative
wonderfulll amezing                                                     i will order more later,Negative
 the package says you ll see visible wrinkle repair results in just one week  7 nights   i ve been using this cream for 9 nights on my face and neck  excluding eyelids only  without any visible results the first evening i tried it  my face felt itchy and dry the next morning   since i was aware of the packaging warning that cautions the user about a possible reaction which indicates the product is working  i was not concerned   the irritation didn t continue on any subsequent nights so i continued to apply this cream religiously for 8 more nights  i found the cream to be somewhat moisturizing but that s all the moisturizer also has a strong smell similar to the smell of the self tanning products that are on the market but i was not bothered by this too much as it wears off pretty quickly overall  this product gets zero stars for wrinkle repair results and three stars as a moisturizer   i definitely feel there are better products on the market   i will continue to use this cream until it s finished but would not purchase this in the future  ,Negative
 i bought this at a local store but it was called   #30 darkest brown sweet cola   not   #30 soft black sweet cola   as it is stated on amazon  i m not sure if i got an old new box and they changed the name because of the results people were getting or what  on garnier s website it is still listed as darkest brown  if i was looking for soft black i might be satisfied because my hair did turn out black   which was not what i wanted  luckily my features can carry black hair but if they could not have i would be pretty devastated  i m hoping the color will fade a bit but i ll probably re dye it with a different brand and hope to add some brown depth  this hair color is very one note  very flat and not rich at all this was the first time i ve used a garnier hair dye and it will be the last  not only was the color too dark  for the box i got  but it also turned my hair into hay  i should have known better because their shampoo does the same thing to my hair and i ve thrown out their products before  but everyone is always raving about their dye so i gave in  there was nothing nourishing about the conditioner included either  i could tell it was doing nothing to help my hair while i was trying to massage it in  once i was out of the shower i had to use spray in conditioner in order to brush my hair out without feeling like i was tearing it apart  i ve been conditioning it like crazy to try to get some of its life back and cut the frizz down that was left behind i have very thick and longer hair  it comes to the middle of my shoulders  and one box only covered half of my head  i m glad i got 2 boxes just in case but even if my hair was shorter i still wouldn t have been able to cover it all  unless your hair is very thin i would advise you to get 2 boxes if you decide to try this dye i have used the new john frieda foam in color 3n deep brown black and it matched the box color depicted pretty well  it was a dark  multidimensional brown and in no way the flat black i have now  it seemed to fade fast however  so i was hoping for something with better staying power  the foam is much easier to apply as well  i did not use the garnier foam because i have not heard good things about it unlike the cream  ,Negative
 i tried this product a few months ago  i found the formula too thin and runny and difficult to spread  it was actually a little streaky   and it provided poor coverage with weak pigmentation  i even shook it to mix it  also  the colour did not match my skin tone  i m peachy toned  and the lightest tone made me look like i was wearing a mask  the only upsides i can think of are that this moisturizer contains sunscreen and i liked the herbal smell to it and the fact that it had natural ingredients  i think i ll stick to my korean bb creams though  ,Negative
 my foot   if you have any kinds of allergic or sensitivity to scents put this product back   i have migraines and triggers most always center around smells  although this product might be ok and i just mean ok  the smell makes it quite nauseating   if you like the scent thieves then go ahead and try it i just couldn t get around that smell   when will manufacturers get that   if we put it on our face which is alot of the time sensitive anyway  why do they keep flocking us with smelly products   most people know that if it has a scent in it the product most always has alcohol too but  for the sake of a review i will tell you this   i did give this product a try and after washing my face before i went to bed with my normal cleanser and my face being totally void of anything  i applied this cream  it does have a nice texture and creaminess to it   it went on well and felt clean and not at all greasy   very nice   but then this   it never dried or went in   it stayed on top of my skin and got very sticky within a period of about 10 minutes and the cream was still sticky when i woke up the next morning   my whole face was sticky this claims to be an am pm cream but if it stays on top of my skin during the night i m sure it will do the same during the day and my face will be sticky underneath my makeup   but  no i didn t try it during the day   i don t even want this cream on my hands   the scent itself isn t worth the usefulness of the cream  ,Negative
 this serum aborb pretty fast after applying and you don t feel oily at all  i haven t tried it for a long time but i think it makes your skin smooth and feel well  the circle takes time to dissappear i think  customer service is good  so don t worry  they have registered delivery update i don t think the product works  it seems like water to me  i don t see any change  ,Positive
love this got them pretty fast and thw size of this are great   and the price is so good too   i got three and i am very happy with it  ,Positive
 i purchased this after it was recommended by a specialist at bloomingdale s   i am in my early 30s have combination skin  dry for the most part  but an oily forehead    my skin is not sensitive by any means   i used this as directed and it made my skin worse than it has ever been   my chin broke out in severe acne  which i normally do not have   while the rest of my face turned red and splotchy  almost like a rash    it also left most of my face feeling itchy   i went from using just powder on my face to having to use full coverage make up to cover up the mess this left   luckily  i was able to return it to the store for a full refund   it s been almost a week since i ve stopped using it and i m still working on repairing the damage this caused to my face   i would not recommend this product to anyone   and  i m steering clear from this company all together  ,Negative
 in order to be fair  i want to state first that i have long  thick  auburn hair  there is a bit of curl to it  very much so when it is short  and my hair will stick out in a hundred different directions on a humid day  thanks  mom    so  while this hair stick is absolutely stunning  i had to use other products  and clips  to complete my look  especially considering that my usual hair routine is to chuck it into a ponytail and braid it design & usehair sticks date back many centuries  especially in the far east  as japanese women  especially during the edo period  would put their hair into elaborate up dos and use hairpins  as well as other hair accouterments  to keep their style from falling out  during that time  hairpins were also a status symbol  with the wealthiest women having them made in various fine metals with elaborate details  in terms of using the hair stick  nothing has really changed in modern times  this pin functions the same as those created centuries ago  although it is infinitely cheaper than one made of pure jade  for instance as you can see from the picture  this hair stick is a bronze gold color with colored rhinestones  a raised filigree  and a chain that dangles from the head of the piece  if looking at the hairpin from the front  meaning  the side with the rhinestones for decoration   the gems are set to look like leaves circling counter clockwise on a vine  on the left side there are two large and two medium sized gems used to create the wings of a butterfly  the tips of the antennae on the butterfly also have rhinestones  the chain actually dangles from a secondary loop in the chain  resulting in two ends  each end has a different stone  one is a larger teardrop and the other is a small  faceted amethyst qualitythe quality of this hair pin is what amazes me  especially considering the low cost  it is not easy to tell from the vendor s photo of the piece  but the detailing on this piece is beautiful  it weighs a bit  coming in at 0 953 oz   27 03 g    and feels like it could withstand a lot of abuse  while it is heavier than i expected  it is still lightweight enough to hold a bun in place without pulling itself out of my hair  the only complaint that i have is that you have to be careful with the chain that dangles from the head of the hairpin  it sometimes gets tangled in my hair and i have to gently coax it out for fear of snapping the chain  or pulling out my hair  i said it before  but let me say it again  this hair stick is gorgeous  as a comparison  i bought some   chopsticks   for my hair that were made by goody  they were some sort of amber colored polymer  and they cost me more than this metal hairpin  the goody brand had some grooves along the middle parts of each stick in order to keep them in place and not slide out of your hair  while this pin doesn t have that  the raised filigree up and down the length of the stick serves the same purpose overallwhile some may consider this hairpin a bit ostentatious  i consider it a beautiful accessory to any outfit  whether you want to add a touch of elegance to your hairdo or just like it for its great construction to keep your hair in place  this piece is definitely worth the wait to have in your jewelry box  combined with other items that the vendor carries  you can have a rhinestone bracelet in the shape of a peacock  two barrettes with a beautiful swirl  with more rhinestones  of course    and a lovely rhinestone owl necklace to finish off the ensemble  conversely  if you want to take the more modest approach  just wearing this hair stick for the practical purpose of maintaining your messy up do makes this piece a must have  with the free shipping and insanely low cost  as long as you can wait for the item to arrive from china  it took about two weeks   what do you have to lose  worst case  if it is not to your taste  it would make a beautiful gift to someone you care about so what are you waiting for  order a hairpin for yourself and a few for your friends for a great stocking stuffer or as a birthday present  you will love it ***ps  i uploaded some of my own pictures of the hairpin in order to better explain the item description that i typed  above *** ,Positive
 feels good on and does not aggravate my acne prone skin   provides enough coverage to even out skin and offers some sun protection   have been using this for years  recently the packaging changed    tried other drug store brands and other neutrogena bases but i always come back to this   just wish cvs and walmart would carry more than 8 colors where i am     i ended up buying two colors and mixing   it s a bit of a pain and more expensive in one go   other stores used to carry more colors but  even then  neutrogena colors tend to be too pink for me     i don t love my yellow y complexion but i want my makeup to blend rather than look like a mask with a different skin color from the neck down  ,Positive
 this color is a little darker and more sparkly than i had anticipated  but it s a good product  i probably would repurchase in another color  ,Positive
 i have been using this for 2 months and it is amazing  my skin looks and feels brighter and smoother   i have some stubborn dark sun spots that are taking longer to fade but nonetheless this product does work  you are only supposed to use it for 3 months then give your skin a rest and then other products will do fine for maintenance   this product also has glycolic in it which keeps my skin clear and refines my pores as well   i love all of the image skin care products just make sure when you purchase through amazon that it has an original seal around the opening of the bottle to ensure that it is authentic  ,Positive
my hands down favorite favorite lotion  this lotion is non greasy but absorbs really well into dry thirsty skin without feeling thick or sticky  the scent is very natural and light so there isn t any irritating perfumes or bothersome smell to it  and the best part is the lotion lasts all day so you won t see scaly skin a few hours later  the best time to apply is after a shower and you re good to go but it s great anytime  i use it all year round    and the price is cheap on amazon compared to regular stores ,Positive
 this is not any softer than any other cheap powder brush i ve used   the bristles are some kind of dyed animal fur but nowhere on the internet on on the company site could i find out what kind   i suspect goat   certainly nothing special   the bristles have an overwhelming smell   moth balls plus dry cleaning fluid   really strong fumes   and finally  when i pulled the brush from its plastic pouch the black plastic and white plastic sections came unglued very cheap  smelly  below average makeup brush  ,Negative
 this deep conditioner did not outperform the drugstore brands   or at least not for my hair type  i am caucasian with bleachy blonde hair that is very dry & damaged  i was hoping that this project would help mend it  and in fact  i was kind of concerned that this product would actually be   overkill    i was disappointed  my hair was no more silky or detangled than when i ve used cheaper deep conditioners from lines such as garnier fructis or loreal s sulfate free line   i have no problem spending money on a good deep conditioner  and that s what i was looking for   maybe this product works better on other hair types  but i wanted to write this review for anyone with my hair type who might be considering it  it just didn t work on a positive note  the fragrance of this product is very  very strong when it is in the container  but it does not over perfume your hair  ,Negative
 the number 2 ingredient in this toner is sd alcohol which does a great job of immediately degreasing your skin  but in the long run  it will cause your oil glands to produce more oil to make up for the drying effect of the alcohol  i like that it has aha and beta hydroxy acids  but looking for another toner without alcohol  any suggestions  i ve tried the neutrogena alcohol free toner and need something a little stronger for my slightly oily  more acne prone skin  ,Positive
 i bought this thinking it seemed too good to be true    and i was absolutely correct   i was getting married and i wanted to be sure i could zap any zit that might try to pop up just before the wedding  so i got the disposable version   i had a zit on my neck and we used it on there and it felt like someone was putting a cigarette out on my neck   i have tattoos  several of them  so i m not a wuss when it comes to pain  but this did hurt   i tried it on another one and it just felt warm    i don t know why it was so inconsistent anyway  there are so many rules on the kind of zits it can and cannot be used on   basically narrowing it down to nothing   if the zit has a whitehead   you can t use it   if it s one of those deep down iceberg types  you can t use it     i tried it every chance i got and it never ever had any effect on them   i may as well have done nothing   i don t have bad skin either    i get one or 2 here or there like once every few months  so it really should have worked for me according to its instructions don t waste your money   it does absolutely *****nothing***** whatsoever  ,Negative
 this stuff really does a good job of controlling breakouts  i tried it on a spot that was coming out and the next day the redness was quite reduced  it won t completely get rid of the pimple  well not in my case but helps reduce it and along with the other products in this line  drys the acne out faster  ,Positive
 this item was exactly as it was described and i am happy with it  i would buy again  thank you ,Positive
 i did not like this product   it made my hair hard and brittle  did not do anything for my hair  ,Negative
 i recently started breaking out on my cheeks and jawline which was never a problem area when i was in my teens  this works if you use it just like the directions say  on clean skin  once a day initially then increase to several times daily  on day two i use it like every 2 hours it makes the pimple or  in my case  underground monster  less visible and less irritating  it gets rid of any pain or soreness that makes me want to pick and pop  after day two it completely disappears honestly  the best thing about this product is that it makes me keep my hands off my face which is likely why i break out in the first place  oh  and i started changing my pillow case every night  ,Positive
 garbage  i would give it no stars if i could this product stick to your nails and have to be soaked of to be removed  it s not a form because other forms pop of when dry  do not buy  terrible product  ,Negative
 various sizes of black and white hex shapes  bars and dots  whirled away in a clear lacquer   fun in a bottle   looks great when applied over a candy red apple  sparkling nail color   works best when pick shapes out and apply with a stylus or orange stick before brushing on   thick consistency works to level out chunks   like confetti for nails  ,Positive
 well  apparently  i m not sophisticated enough for this perfume  because it smells amazing on my mom and rather boring on me  so  i bought her a gift set with the eau de toilette and she loved it to me  and i have no idea what notes are in it  it s a very sharp scent  it has a hint of rose or rose pepper that gives it a quite feminine air  yet with no sweetness  i think it is better for summer time  because it s rather   cold   and fresh  definitely a very sophisticated perfume  ,Positive
 on a daily basis  i have used old spice high endurance anti perspirant & deodorant  invisible solid  pure sport  3 0 oz  old spice high endurance invisible solid pure sport scent anti perspirant & deodorant 3 oz twin pack   for as long as i can remember   anything else i tried would cause a red  burning rash inside both of my armpits   i ve tried sample after sample of antiperspirant and i ve always experienced the same reaction   i felt like a slave to old spice high endurance pure sport   it has always been inconvenient for me when i travel   i had to use only this product   not every pharmacy  convenience store or grocery store carries it   furthermore  it had to be the white solid   sometimes  the gel would also give me a rash fortunately  the amazon vine program sent me the dove men+care cool silver antiperspirant  2 7 oz   it doesn t give me a rash  despite the fact that it has a strong formula that provides 48 hour protection against odious perspiration   it only needs to be applied once in the morning   in fact  i ve forgotten to apply it in the morning after taking my shower and i still felt protected and dry all day   this deodorant  therefore  is highly recommended for busy men  like me  who lead very active lives   it has a masculine appearance and a pleasant masculine scent that reminds me of my old spice high endurance pure sport   it is marketed for the athletic man with its sleek  easy to grip design   it can easily be carried in a shaving kit also  i have gone to special events in the evening  such as the recent wedding of my girlfriend s niece  and reapplied the dove cool silver antiperspirant in order to give me confidence that i was still protected and would remain protected throughout the evening    at the wedding  there was dancing and i sweated a lot    i didn t have to worry about my skin becoming too dry or flaky   this dove antiperspirant has moisturizers   the white solid antiperspirant stick is extremely easy to lower and raise due to its large base which completely swivels to the left or right   turning it counterclockwise raises the stick and turning it clockwise lowers it   i also love the fact that   made in usa   is clearly stamped on the bottom the dove men+care cool silver non irritant antiperspirant costs nearly twice as much as my old spice high endurance  pure sport  anti perspirant & deodorant  but it is worth the extra price   also  i like knowing that i m not limited to only using old spice high endurance pure sport   there are other brands on the market that won t give me a rash   deodorant is one of those hygiene products  such as toothpaste and shampoo  that one must use in order to face the public   if i need to make budget cuts  i ll simply stop using luxury products such as expensive face lotions and body washes joseph b  hoyos ,Positive
 this is a pretty blue but i have the sparkly harmony christmas set of 5 colors   gold  silver  green  red & blue unfortunately  and i think this is very sneaky   this is the exact same color as   holiday party blues     i have a whole bottle of that blue and now i have a whole another color of blue which is the same   i don t want two bluesthat are exactly alike   yet now i m stuck with them the description of this color should say it s the same color as   holiday party blues    in the event that someone might have the christmas set already   if this blue is all you wanted  then you could buy this and only this i repeat   if you have the christmas set of harmony gelish  don t buy  cause the two blues are the same  ,Negative
 but i don t feel that it had any positive effect on my face  i don t see any results  but it s possible that i didn t use it enough  ,Negative
 it seems this product did not serve well after repeated use   despite the claim of non irritant  it did cause such and use has been discontinued while many have found this to be quite effective and gentle  one can only judge on personal experience  skin sensitivity and body chemistry in addiiton  warnings on the back on the antiperspirant included   consult a doctor before use if you have kidney disease  ,Negative
this lotion lasts longer than any bath and body works or victoria s secret lotion  i had used the lavender one when i was away on vacation and noticed how long it lasted  couldn t find the lavender in stores so i went with the cherry blossom  it has the best scent ever and last so long i didn t even have to spray my body splash on after  it has a nice light scent that lingers for hours ,Positive
will not repurchase again sorry   but i did not like the smell   i did not like putting all of those chemicals in my hair,Negative
smells funny but does the job  my lashes never fall off  i can shake my head at a rock concert and head bang all i want and my lashes wouldn t fall off ,Negative
 these hard bristles don t grab hair  so it makes curling and drying almost impossible  i returned it  i don t see how this could work for anyone  ,Negative
 i have purchased this color from the store before and it came out great  a deep  bright red   but when i ordered it on amazon  nope   my hair came out an ugly brown  my hair was already a medium brown    the mixture went on red but my hair didn t come out nowhere near that color  and that usually happens when the product has been sitting forever   yes  i left it on the recommended amount of time  ,Negative
great for thick and curly hair  it tames all the frizzes and leaves your hair soft and smooth  great conditioner,Positive
i decided to try this pads after reading the other reviews   i have to say that i actually think they might be helping   it s nothing major but it s enough of a difference to keep me using them in the hopes that my wrinkles will improve    maybe it s just me but i m hopeful so i would definitely consider trying these   i think if you are a bit younger it might work a lot better than it does for this older gal ,Negative
i love chi irons and hair products and this iron is no exception  it is thin so you can get in waves and makes your hair so smooth and beautiful ,Positive
don t ever buy another manicure brush from a beauty supplier  this is the best value for your money and is the exact same quality product ,Negative
 waste of money they don t work all 4 sides are the same  except for the colors  even if there was a noticeable difference in the 4 sides  there is no way to know which order to use the sides in i threw them in the trash  ,Negative
 this curling iron heats up so fast you can adjust the heat settings manually to your preference  as well as that it heats up to 450 degrees the bad thing 1  it makes your hair smell bad  and also it doesnt create any curls  only gives volume  but then hair goes flat  ,Positive
 i love this product  it s great for detangling  in leave conditioner and deep conditioning  it s a little pricey but it s worth it  ,Positive
 doesn t do anything at all  it does keep your skin moist  but it doesn t correct anything  it s too expensive for not keeping up with promises ,Positive
this is a great stamper  works well w multiple brand polishes and plates  the double end is handy for full nail patterns or single stamp designs  the length of stamper is easier to handle than other stampers w a small handle  would buy again and recommend ,Positive
 the product was not what they said it was going to be the tips are not curves they come just like a press on nail kind of i wont be using them  the only reason i am not sending them back is because i really dont want to deal with a hassle ,Negative
 wonderful product   it s been effective for clearing breakouts  reducing heal time and severity  and it s light and moisturizing   i still need to use my regular moisturizer in some spots  but not as much now  also  i have sensitive skin that turns red easily  but i ve not had any issues at all with the body shop tea tree products  this lotion also doesn t smell bad and i read the ingredients to make sure there aren t any pore cloggers or irritants contained   i m happy to say i did not find any comediogenic ingredients   also you get a lot of product for the price  it s about 1 7 oz  and it lasts a long time for me   i ve been using my last bottle about a month  everyday  and i m not even getting close to running out yet  i hope the body shop never discontinues the tea tree products  ,Positive
 i just purchased this cleanser and found it to be harsh  i have good skin  but it s sensitive and was quite disappointed to find my skin very tight and dry after using it  i think it s better suited for normal to oily skin if you want a high quality skin exfoliate that doesn t leave your skin dry  check out louisebianco com   they make a product called derma polish   it s not listed on their website so you have to call them to order it   it s about $25 but it s remarkable in that it removes dead skin and leaves your skin feeling moist and looking great  ,Negative
 i have been looking for the perfect eyeliner for a few years one that doesn t smudge or cake around my eyes after 8 hours after  trying urban decay  i no longer need to look for the perfect eyeliner it lasts all day and still looks great when i get home after a long day  ,Positive
 i am a 50 year old man who struggles with facial rosacea  i am constantly on the hunt for a lotion that will soothe my face without irritating my skin  many of the lotions that i have tried make my face burn and itch  dove s new men care sensitive face lotion is a godsend  it goes on easily and spreads readily upon my face  it is a thicker lotion  but if you get your face wet before applying lotion it thins it out and you don t need to use very much  it absorbs into the skin quickly and dries without leaving a greasy feeling  it keeps my face feeling soft and supple all day long without causing any of the redness that has plagued me for year  i highly recommend this product for anyone who struggles with skin issues  it s very gentle yet effective  ,Positive
hair loves this stuff   best hot oil treatment product for my natural hair   it contains henna so be sure to deep condition after washing it out ,Positive
 this lotion seems to just sit on the surface  does not penetrate or soften  my hands just end up looking shiny  ,Positive
 for the price  this is just okay   it really didn t do anything to my hair so i definitely woudn t buy it again   regular leaving in conditioners work better  i thought that this would be quick and easy  which it is  but with virtually no results  would not buy again because it s a waste of money  ,Negative
 love this moisturizer   i have very dry  prematurely aging skin   everything about this moisturizer is wonderful   good  thick texture but still absorbs completely   does not irritate my skin   gets rid of that tight feeling  and leaves my skin feeling incredibly soft and smooth   i also love that since the last tube i bought  did i mention it lasts forever    dermalogica has removed the parabens from their formulas   love  love  love   and love the amazon price  ,Positive
 very nice  a little heavy  i get one of these cheap hair things for my wife every couple of weeks  takes a while for delivery but well worth the price  ,Positive
this product didn t work for me at all  it made my hair look like it was just covered in dust  worst it got everywhere in my bathroom  i applied it only once & threw it away ,Negative
 made from cheap plastic and imperfection is highly visible after applying polish  i use it for gel polish that requires led lamp curing  the oval shape doesn t fit most at home lamps  so only the skinny side can be used  this item was shipped from hong kong and it took almost 2 months to arrive  ,Negative
 you think you re getting a great facial scrub  but it s actually resurfacing  these are amazing little disks  one side soft the other a more loofa  don t forget your neck  ,Positive
 i m testing long curly hair against a very humid environment here in dc  and i haven t seen any difference between using this product and going without it   i will not spend the money on it again because it doesn t fight the frizz as i expected it would  ,Negative
 i just don t like this  the scent is supposed to be subtle  but it s overpowering to me and neither manly nor pleasant  it seems to do a well enough job cleaning and rinsing off  but that can be said of just about any body wash product  or soap for that matter   i m not really liking it for washing my face either  i use a different dove product for that  as it really doesn t seem to get deep into the pores  my skin feels about the same  i ll finish this bottle  but this won t make me quit buying old spice   it does what it s supposed to do  but i can t get past the smell   it s just not for me  ,Negative
i bought this thinking it would be less concentarted and also easy to apply than the original one  treid for 2 days and it gave bad eczema on my todller  stopped using this for 2 days and its all gone ,Negative
read the reviews and really thought this would be a great product   if you have wrinkle skin on your eye lids forget about buying ,Negative
 it smells very good  it just doesn t last long at all   i ve had bath & body works body sprays that have lasted longer than this  do better  taylor swift  do better  ,Positive
 i am a 42 year old female with fine brown hair that is colored blond  and cut in a bob to just above my shoulders   all of the women in my family have fine hair  which gets sparse in their older age   up until this year  this has not been a problem as my hair was fine but it wasn t falling out so i could just use volumizing products to give it the volume that i needed but  earlier this year  i noticed that my hair started falling out   turned out that it was due to undiagnosed hypothyroidism   the doctor put me on meds which leveled out my thryoid  and my hair stopped falling out  which was great but  i noticed that my hair never grew back from when it fell out initially and it s very thin in the front and temple section   i am trying to decide how to address this   rogaine   i bought the nioxin starter kit for my style of hair but haven t tried that yet   so  i thought  thickening spray   sounds like a good option to get started   i read the reviews and thought that it was worth a shot i only used this once as it was useless   basically  it looks like water   it has the color and texture of water   the only reason why i knew that it wasn t water is because it has a slight chemical smell to it  which goes away when it s dry    but  it did absolutely nothing to thicken my hair   it was like i sprayed water on it it didn t say that it was a product that built up on your hair  like some thickeners need to do over a few weeks using it daily  so i assumed that i would be able to notice a difference after one usage   i don t know   maybe the directions need to be more clear  maybe i used it wrong   for me  i might as well have sprayed water on my hair in summary  i will not be ordering this product again   i would have returned it  but since the purchase price was only about $7  it wasn t worth the return shipping cost to do that  ,Negative
i like this moisturizer it is light yet effective  i have acne prone skin and i can use this w o suffering breakouts  i highly recommend this entire line for acne and or pigment challenges  i use this as my evening moisturizer and use the oily skin sunscreen moisturizer in the mornings  although if you have a separate sunscreen you can use this during the day since it is light ,Positive
 this stuff is amazing  it gives me just enough color to look like i laid out in the sun but doesn t turn me orange  however you will start to get a little orangey brown looking if you keep re applying too much  my recommendation  do it two days in a row and then start doing it every other day just to keep up the color  unless you don t shower every day then just do it on the days you shower after exfoliating   i love the mitt because it makes everything go on even  ,Positive
 this is not what i expected  the oil is nice and no problems  just the scent is not what i remembered  to be fair  it is probably me not the product  ,Negative
 this is not a true masculine scent as mentioned on at least one post  that being said  it would be very heavy for a female to wear  it is a clean spicy scent that i happen to find enjoyable  it reminds me a bit of the old british sterling aftershave  the bottle is awesome to look at  i have about 15 other high end colognes  this one ranks in the top 5  ,Positive
 this product smells really  really good  but does very little for me   kind of a waste of money   its okay for a little &#34 freshen up&#34  like its supposed to be  but doesn t really make a difference otherwise  ,Negative
or other hard to reach places that tend to break out   it really works if you use it consistently after bathing,Positive
 i cannot comment on the overall effectiveness of this product  because i didn t make it that far  when i applied the mask to my face  i instantly became nauseous due to the wretched smell of this stuff  it literally smelled like a diaper pail  i had to take it off right away because the smell was so horrid  and i washed my face three times afterwards until i couldn t smell the foul odor anymore  it s possible i got a bad batch  but i don t plan on shelling out another $69 to find out  ,Negative
 rosehip oil has been touted as a &#34 miracle&#34  product that helps the skin with wrinkles  scars  anti aging and many other issues  there are different brands out there with varying levels of approval from users  prior to using voilave s rosehip oil i was using the trilogy rosehip oil i love the voilave oil  first and foremost it s a pure oil without any fillers  it s very light to the touch and absorbs smoothly and beautifully into the skin  there is no oily residue  the scent is slightly floral and warm  it does not smell like roses people    it nourishes my combination skin and provides a non greasy  delicate moisture food  when i get out of bed in the morning my skin looks bright and feels incredibly soft  the fine lines around my eyes and mouth  from the side i sleep in  look diminished and my skin looks supple when you use this oil  please don t slather on the oil onto your face all at once   do it in sections and stages  after washing and toning your skin  apply 2 drops to your forehead  take the time to massage it into your forehead area  small circles   if you have oil leftover  move it down to your cheeks  massage until most of it is absorbed  apply 1 2 drops onto each of your cheeks and massage it into the area  when you apply this oil in sections you will not waste the oil and it gives your skin a chance to fully drink it in this is a fantastic product  i have had no regrets whatsoever with this purchase and look forward to buying it again  ,Positive
 what can i say  it doesnt work  i bought this for my mother who is 65  and although her skin is really nice for her age  she has those lines that form around your lips  making it look puckered    very annoying to my mother  so she gave this a whirl and there was literally no change whatsoever  bummer  ,Negative
 i have used this brush for every thing  from applying liquid foundation and powders to blush and bronzer and each application is flawless and looks better than any makeup brush i ve used ,Positive
 i live in south louisiana  and june is quite possibly the most humid time of the year for us   the humidity levels are off the charts to start  i like this shampoo  it has a great lather and a nice smell   it s similar to all of the other shampoos in the pantene line   one thing to especially note is that this shampoo definitely weighs your hair down  which is great for humid areas  my hair doesn t frizz up the moment i walk outside  but i also feel like it s a little   too   heavy    almost looks like i didn t wash it my hair is medium to thick texture  some natural curl to it  and frizzes up instantly in humid weather   the shampoo does what it says  it really is a hair solution for frizzy hair  but it does have a con   it weighs my hair down just a bit too much  ,Positive
 ladies this product has no exotic ingredient that warrants this kind of price  you can buy skin firming creams at vitacost with dmae the so called firming agent in this under twenty dollars  the second ingredient in this is glycolic acid which may brighten the neck skin by sloughing and turning over skins cells  you can also use a washcloth or salux to do so save your money  ,Negative
 after one use of this sunscreen  my face and neck broke out  i had clear skin before this  i have always thought of neutrogena as such a clean brand  but i was way off on this one  it was every bit as bad as chemical sunscreen and it made my skin look oily  i m still trying to clear my skin because of this   microdermabrasion  salicylic acid masks   getting my money back wouldn t make up for what i m going through because of this product  ,Negative
 i always keep a pump bottle of face wash with 2% salicylic acid at my sink for morning and evening uses  i ve tried several brands  and i like this biore version as well as any others  the salicylic acid helps control any tendency towards acne without being too harsh for me  biore foams and rinses  leaving my combination skin nice and clean  i haven t noticed any drying or irritation  although this has   ice   in the name  there s just a very mild cooling sensation from the menthol  perhaps even less than i notice frombiore acne clearing scrub  1% sal acid   4 5 ounce one minor note of comparison  some pump bottles  likeclean & clear essentials foaming facial cleanser  8 fl oz  will lock in place if twisted  so that the bottle can be packed without making a mess  biore s pump doesn t lock into place   a small detail that will only matter to you if you want to travel with this bottle  ,Positive
 big but maybe too soft  the big part is workable and kinda nice but    and here s the big negative the brush is literally too soft to pick up a significant amount of powder  maybe there are other powdersthat are better suited for this brush  i will keep it & use it  but only as a  finishing  brush with the powderi currently use  ,Negative
 i put just a few drops of this in some burts bees baby wash  in a separate container  and washed my chihuahua and got all of her fleas gone   however  do not use a lot of his because it has been found to be dangerous to animals and their system   use only a few drops   never get near their eyes or in their nose or mouth   however  you cannot keep letting the dog go out in an untreated yard as fleas will come back   but for a cheap shampoo  if u already have ingredients  it really does the job of a big brand flea soap  ,Negative
tore up the first time i used them   useless product  did not even stay intact long enough to soak off a single nail  complete rip off ,Negative
nothing special about this shampoo  the scent is not particularly pleasant but the only good part about the scent is that it is not very strong  my hair was not left feeling exceptionally clean or smooth  the same is true of my scalp which had some itch pre shampoo and kept the same itch post shampoo  this is not the kind of shampoo i would purchase or even use again  it is just blah ,Positive
the wheel is very neat and organized and the gems are great  they come in different sizes and there s so many of them to use  i don t think i ll ever run out of them  this is definitely a must buy ,Positive
 i have never used this before   i had it in my wish list and saw a price drop  so i ordered it   it is so easy and lasts all day   i love this and would order it again  ,Positive
 i love fake bake flawless  like so much that i have recommended it to every person i know  i have bought several other products on a whim thinking they may work similarly or better  but they haven t  so i went to order more flawless and it wouldn t arrive in time with my prime shipping however this fake bake lotion would so i took a gamble  reviews seemed okay   when i put the tinted lotion on my skin i was like  ahhhh hello long lost tan friend   i was surprised that there was no fragrance to the lotion even when i first applied it  when i woke up  i couldn t  smell the stale tan in a can smell which was surprising but neat  since i didn t have to work that day   i kept it on for several more hours while i did chores  mid day napped  lounged  etc  well when i finally took a shower  i kept the lotion on for about 18 hours  all of the tint washed down the drain  when i got out  i was pale again like i hadn t put forth the effort to put on self tanner  we all know that to do it properly it s at least a 20 30 minute process  i feel this was a waste of time and money  sorry fake bake   you really let me down  ,Negative
 eye never nourishing repair eye cr&egrave me  by vbeaute  is supposed to be like   an eyelift in a jar     the cr&egrave me is supposed to conceal lines  smooth and silken skin  minimize the appearance of puffiness  and correct lines and wrinkles  according to the product website i ve been using the product for three weeks now  twice daily  and i can t say i see any difference in my skin   my eye area still crinkles up and looks wrinkly when i smile   there s been no   instant   reduction in puffiness upon application   it hasn t irritated my skin  though my eye area has been dry a few mornings so i have questioned how much it was moisturizing even at amazon s price  which is much less than what it sells for at vbeaute s website    i must say that the product is way overpriced for what it delivers  ,Negative
 makes my hair fantastic   dried it quickly and leaves it nice and shiny   i bought the nano version to take to the gym  and its okay  but this puppy is my favorite   i take it on all of my trips  etc   highly recommended  ,Positive
 hey  i gave this 2 stars because i really don t want to  hate  anything  but this product just didn t work for me   at all  i have had better results in thickening my eyebrows and growing my eyelashes with my organic grapeseed oil every night   don t waste your money   ,Negative
 i always meant to buy an expensive straightener   one of these days    but i ve been creaking along on a conair straightener i got several years ago that worked fine for my thick  wavy  and long hair the wahl pro straightener is similar to the conair  but with improvements in design and quality the digital display  the swivel cord  multiple heat settings are nice features  but perhaps my favorite one is the attached comb  i got used to that on the old conair i have  and i must admit  at least for me  it makes straightening to a lot faster and smoother  it s not so much that it combs your hair  but acts more like a guide to pull the hair taut between the tourmaline plates   a nice touch the heat setting display isn t kidding  this baby gets hot when the dial is turned up  since i m probably like most women and use way more heat based hair appliances than can possibly be good for one s locks  the lower settings do an excellent job without the frying experience another thoughtful feature is that the plates   lock  to make storage a breeze  one thing my creaky old conair lacks  and boy  am i tired of that thing falling on me in the linen closet  this straightener works fine and has enough features to make the price very reasonable  that s why i don t get the conditioning strip  it s fairly useless as far as i can tell  and god knows any number of styling products can produce a much better result at a much lower cost  these strips are expensive when it s time to replace them  the conditioning strip is a gimmick  and an unnecessary one  the straightener is quite good without bothering with it the price of the wahl is reasonable  but i guess i m just spoiled  i purchased my old straightener for about $20 less  and i ve certainly gotten my use out of it and been pleased with it overall the wahl is a pricier replacement  the extra features make the extra cost somewhat worthwhile  esp  since the conair model i had isn t being manufacturered anymore if the price were very much higher than it is  i d say spend a few more bucks and go with a babyliss or a chi on sale  and after reading a lot of reviews maybe it s my frugal nature  or the pretty results i got from the wahl  but at this price point  i d say it s a very good investment indeed  ,Positive
 i didn t care for this mascara  it stuck my lashes together  and when it was hot and i would sweat  i had raccoon eyes  clump crusher works much better than this  ,Negative
 when it comes to makeup  i m a very natural girl  i like to keep it simple and easy  when i saw this product  i thought it seemed great because i wouldn t need to buy two different products to contour when i want to  however  this product is just too ridiculous for me to use 1  the bronzer is really dark  even if you use very little  it still looks just weird if you re even slightly light skinned 2  the blush is also pretty dark  it s no where near the pretty powder pink that s shown  it s a very dark rosey color  which makes you look perpetually embarrassed  or maybe just like you re using way too much blush 3  this stuff is filled with sparkles  even if you can get past how dark and misrepresented the colors are  the sparkles just really kill it for me  this might just be a preference  but i don t like glittery contour lines  it s just not flattering i just saved you $8 bucks  as well as half a bottle of your favorite facial scrub and the 4 hours that it would take you to get that awful glitter off your face  exaggeration   you re welcome  ,Negative
love this stuff  it s gentle so i can use it on my face and body  and like with all vanicream products a little goes a long way  great for people with eczema or sensitive skin,Positive
after reading the reviews i bought this hoping it would help my husbands excema  he started seeing a huge difference in one week  the skin no longer looked rough and cracked and became very soft  he no longer has the urge to scratch the area  now after one month of use you can hardly tell he had it  after suffering for two years and seeing a dermatologist its great to finally see something work   this is so amazing ,Positive
 applied nicely  but did not have the look one would expect from a good concealer  there is a shine to this product that is not helpful when you are trying to cover up something    it draws attention to it instead  in view of the fact that there are so many other really excellent products out there to do the job right  i d recommend that you pass on spending your hard earned cash on revlon photoready concealer this was a surprising disappointment because the revlon photoready primer is fabulous  and i ve gotten tons of compliments since i ve started using it  ,Positive
 if you are looking for oil free  when i say oil free i mean &#34 non comedogenic&#34   this isn t it when people usually look for oil free cosmetic products  they are looking for non comedogenic  free of substances  usually oil  that clogs your pores  products  just because it doesn t have any ingredients with word &#34 oil&#34  doesn t really make it oil free  it s a shame how neutrogena deceptively markets this product as oil free moisturizer as they make great products that are non comedogenic already look  i would imagine that it works for some people who aren t as acne prone sensitive to oil  hence the high review score  i find that it is helpful to clarify some of the marketing jargons companies use to mislead people use non comedogenic moisturizer  and separate light oil free sunscreen  if you want to be cautious  ,Positive
 yeah  i caved  i bought the cocoa butter scented one this time  it reeks  so when i buy it again i ll return to the regular scent  why did i do it  well  it is quick and convenient  i need heavier moisturizer due to extremely dry skin  but for everyday spray it on  smooth it in and go  this stuff is very nice  it is an unnecessary indulgence  but the convenience makes it irresistible to me  especially good for moisturizing the back and hard to reach areas  don t get it on the floor unless you plan to go skating  it is super slippery  it does absorb into skin very quickly and eases the discomfort of dry skin to some degree  although it s not up there with something like eucerin  which is basically white axle grease  but the spray and go is nice and light and it is convenient  ,Negative
 the product is not what i have ordered  it is not metal studs  it is just tiny sparkling gold rhinestone ,Negative
i have thinning hair & this product works well to hold the style i want   smells great & you don t need to use a lot ,Positive
this gets too hot and does not even curl  i do not like it  guess ill be using my old one ,Negative
 looks completely natural  not sticky or heavy  no helmet head  brushes out easily   my hair is long and pretty thick and this product is strong enough to keep it out of my eyes   that said  i don t care for the smell  which lasts for hours    my husband doesn t mind it  ,Negative
 i do 30 day keratin treatments at home   i m between treatments  although my hair hasn t reverted back to natural  i also ran out of my pureshine brilliant blowout product   i saw this renpure flat iron spray on the store shelf yesterday and decided to try it   absolutely horrible   my hair looks and feels like straw   it s dry and stiff  the iron dragged across my hair  no silkiness or movement whatsoever   if you re used to real keratin treatments  then don t use this stuff  ,Negative
 i don t like makeup  but i am forever chasing the youth fountain in a form of cream in a jar   i would say loressen vitaleyes eye cream is not that good  after using it for 5 days my boyfriend asked me if i was tired because i had dark circles under my eyes  he didn t know about this cream  i went to the mirror and had the darkest circles i ve ever seen on my face  yakes  also if you put this cream on before going to sleep  you wake up with your eyes all puffy  if you want to wake up with your eyes all puffy  just go get drunk and totally smashed and get some fun out of it  it s horrid enough when you look in the mirror the next morning and looking back at you is a hungover puffed version of you  however when you buy a product to improve your looks and your days of drinking and partying ceded over 15 years ago  it s even more horrifying it does however makes the skin around my eyes soft and i agree with the old lady smell  it s not very becoming  i often find this smell with creams that i have kept for too long and have to throw away  i got this one at a highly reduced price and i m wondering if it was from an old batch the company wanted to get rid off   the smells fades away in about 20 minutes  so it s not too bad i m always trying new creams  so i will likely try something else next  ,Negative
 mom loved it and used it up before i could use mine up  this is my summer nighttime moisturizer  as my skin gets way too dry in the harsh new england winters for this to be sufficient  love the scent of it and how soft it makes my skin feel  i wish they made one similar with spf  so that i could use it as my daytime lotion too  ,Positive
 i was a little nervous about using this on my face  so i prepared myself by watching the instructional dvd twice and reading all of the enclosed material  the dvd is very reassuring  and very misleading  they make it sound like you just need a little practice at the lowest setting and all will be well  not true right out of the box  my unit functioned poorly with the fine tip attached  i started trying to use it on my forehead just like on the dvd  they must have turned the unit off for those dvd demonstrations  you cannot slide the tip smoothly across your face like that  if you have adequate suction  as soon as you start to move across your skin  the tip pops off your face  with my unit  suction was sporadic and mostly nonexistent with the fine tip attached i switched to the precision tip  which gave me more reliable suction  but i still couldn t use it as instructed  because it hurts  i was not pressing hard  but it was like pushing sandpaper tightly against your face and then dragging it across the skin  i don t have particularly sensitive skin  but this was so harsh that i decided to check some reviews before possibly damaging my skin  i m glad i did  i won t be using this unit on my face again  one reviewer mentioned that people have been injured by this product  and she herself was under a doctor s care to heal the damage it did to her skin on the dvd they say your face will have some redness for about 30 minutes after a treatment  once again  untrue  many hours after use  there were still red patches on my face  and my forehead and nose had a burning sensation i thought maybe i could at least get some benefit from the machine by using it on the dry and calloused places on my feet  for that i used the coarse tip and a higher suction level  it was a complete waste of time  the only place you can get suction is on the bottoms of your feet  no edges or contours  because you have to the the entire tip flat against your skin to get suction  i have big calluses on the outer edges of my big toes  and there was no way i could get the tip flat enough to get any suction in that area i cannot recommend this product  and i suggest you read a large number of reviews carefully before making your purchase decision  i ll stick with more gentle forms of exfoliation  and accept my fate of being old and ugly  ,Negative
i purchased this at target for $5 00  that should have been my first clue   i have to use about a cup of the conditioner before my hair is saturated enough to run my fingers through  i ve used this conditioner twice and i ve notice that my hair is snapping and breaking a lot more when brushing  i can even feel strands snapping when i pull it up in a pony tail  my hair is shinny and smooth but it also has zero body  i will not purchase again  i m going to see if i can return it ,Positive
this is a top coat    the only color that glows is blue    n it glows green    i thought it would be better     too expensive to suck sooooo much,Negative
 i purchased this item  hoping to cut down on the time i spend in the morning blow drying and flat ironing my hair  i probably should have known that something written up to do both so miraculously was too good to be true no  this product is in no way a substitute for both blow drying and flat ironing in the traditional manner  it simply doesn t have the ability to dry like a dryer can  the worst part  is that regardless of whether you have the 1   or 2   plates  neither can effectively do anything for the hair closest to your scalp  you end up with frizzy  sticky  damp hair near your scalp  which looks awful and feels even worse stick with your usual styling tools  this one could probably be an effective flatiron  but only after the blow drying is complete  ,Negative
this is so far the best dry shampoo i have tried   only bad thing is white powder and may show thru my dark hair if i apply too much   i have tried others in spray including ones identify for dark brown hair color    but does not works like this one   i can be almost have a week without washing my hair after using it and it doesnt smell or feels dirty or oily   i have fone normal to oily hair ,Positive
this stuff will wipe away eye make up and face make up with no problem yet still leave your skin supple and not dry ,Negative
this brush is the best for smudging eyeliner for a smokey affect or just to soften the line  it is very dense and firm which softens waterproof eyeliner that can be difficult to soften  it cleans easily and is very well made  a great price for it also ,Positive
 i ll start by saying i have very sensitive skin  and this did not bother me  so that s definitely a positive  my skin is also very dry  and this is a nice thick  unscented cream that moisturizes without leaving a greasy feel  as far as the wrinkle reducing power  we ll have to see  it claims visible results within 5 weeks  so i ll have to wait a little longer  in the meantime  it s a great moisturizer for sensitive skin for before bed and under my makeup in the morning  ,Positive
 i will continue to use after my showers  as it really makes my skin feel soft  and i love the apricot oil along with the fact that it s organic  ,Positive
 way to big    i had to give them to my sister   she likes to decorate them with glitter and stuff   i would not use these in public for any event   well maybe halloween lol    ,Negative
it feels pretty wow when i put this stuff on   small fancy bottle    must be amazing stuff   i put it on but i can t tell a difference   my bottle is now half empty and i can t tell if anything has changed   shouldn t i be able to at least tell a difference visually or texturally i want to like this stuff   the packaging is enticing me every way to like it   so good job to the marketing department   but there is nothing that is indicating that it is working for me at all   i can t justify getting more of this if i can t tell anything is happening ,Negative
 i had a deep suspicion why this product wasn t available in stores and i found out the hard way  basically  my hair came no where near the color on the box  i got mixes of orange  mahogany and dark blonde  needless to say  i wouldn t recommend this  ,Negative
 i ve used mine for a few months now  and since the very first use i noticed a difference in the texture of my skin   i swear it took off 10 years and my skin has a glow to it now   i also seem to have fewer breakouts  basically none   i love the cleaner it came with  but it also works wonderfully with my own basic gel face cleaner   i also bought one for my mom and she loves it too   would highly recommend  ,Positive
 i first found this product while shopping in japantown in san francisco  i did not understand anything on the packaging other than &#34 1 day eyeliner tattoo&#34  and that tag line was good enough for me  this liquid liner pen wears all day  is richly pigmented and really allows me to create dramatic graphic eye looks  it stays on until i take it off and removes easily with my crealine h20 makeup remover  100 thumbs up   seriously  ,Negative
 i wouldn t put this stuff in my hair & waste my time expecting anything    except to maybe smell pretty good  lol i do love this smell  i guess you can also use to help condition your legs after you shave   it works pretty good for that  but like i said  it smells good but it s watered down & it s worthless to my hair   i have waist length hair  i ll stick to my other conditioner  ,Negative
 this soap was a completely waste of my money  first of all it does not moisturize at all it left my skin ashy dried and pretty much upset  i would not recommend this soap  the soap smell like palm oil soap instead of olive oil soap  ,Negative
this is my most favorite shampoo scent ever  i look forward to washing my hair just so i can stand there in sniff the air haha ,Negative
 i started getting mild acne as an adult  most things i ve tried wouldn t work or would dry out my face  i ve been using this for about a month and i have nothing negative to say  it isn t sticky  doesn t have a horrible odor  goes on easy and hasn t made my skin dry  i was complemented by several people  strangers & friends  how good my skin looks  when my friend told me this yesterday i looked in the mirror and said wow my skin does look good  all i really noticed was that acne had diminished but this combo of aha bha has improved my overall complexion  awesome  ,Positive
 i purchased this potion to help with pmsing and it certainly works for me  those times that i want to rip someone s head off or start crying for no reason  i just put a little of this on and it completely calms me right down  this is definitely a much needed potion to help clams exploding nerves  ,Positive
i love this little thing   for the price it work great   makes you feel like you are in a spa ,Positive
 i thought this was really white and it s not  i just wanted a matte white that would show up on dark colors  when painting a flower  etc   and this does not  now i have to spend more money and find a real white  so if you want a white ish color  this one is for you  ,Negative
 this is my alternate color  in between usages of one that s more red   this is a great color  and very gentle on the hair   that s immportant  ,Positive
 after my hair stylist gave me a sample of the curling pudding the week before she dyed my hair  i was anxious to use the famous product that everyone on youtube was talking about  i used it for a week along with my shea butter and it worked out perfectly  my curls were defined  bouncy and nice  fast forward to 4 months later and i decide to buy this product at target  i was anxious to try it again as i received really nice results the first time and i hadn t used it since  i shampoo my hair  deep condition  condition my hair and so on  i decided to blow out my hair and apply the curly pudding and do a braid out  i m on school vacation so i decided to let the braids set in my hair for two days until i need to go out  so the day comes for me to go out and what do i see in my hair  i see tiny little flakes that are covering my entire head  every time i shake there are flakes falling off my head and landing onto clothes  sink  and the floor  i was absolutely disgusted  oh yeah and my curls were not that defined  i could have spent a fraction of the price on something that would have defined my curls and not left flakes  anyway i had to go outside and face the world with my flaky hair  when i returned home i washed it out of my hair and i hate doing that  ,Positive
 the wet comb was cool when i saw it  i use it for the first time and it is really nice on your hair  great product ,Positive
disappointed   these were too dry to remove much of my makeup   barely took off the maybeline tattoo cream shadow  should do okay with powder shadows but pretty worthless for waterproof mascara   hoping they work for touch up so it isn t a total waste of money ,Negative
my kids a boy and a girl love hair spray for some reason i think it makes them feel grown up or something so they sneak and use ours when we are not around  so i thought they would love this but no such luck  first off they did not like the smell and it did not hold my daughters hair in place at all  my son sprayed it once and that was enough try something else ,Negative
either i am bad at putting eyeliners on or there is no eyeliner thats good enough  this one also comes off soon  it doesnt go that smoothly  till now my favorite is himalaya kajal however it doesnt have any staying power at all,Positive
 it s expressly for men  although i really could tell no difference between this and what my wife uses  other than the scent   this is good shampoo  which left my hair delightfully silky and manageable the scent  officially it s   alpine fresh   but i m not smelling the mountains at all   that unique and hard to come by scent will lie forever in the realm ofbadedas  the classic german body wash   now that s alpine  at least in my mind   the scent is not unpleasant at all  in fact  it smells more like a breakfast condiment than a personal cleaning solution   the   fresh   aspect is spot on  but what i m really smelling in this scent is much more like berries and fruit   it s not a heavy  commercial industrial faux fruit smell  like the one that assaults you when your wife drags you into the candle store at the mall   no  the scent is much more natural  light and pleasant   upon rinsing the scent stays but is not overpowering it comes out of the bottle easily and quickly  being just a little bit more viscous than some shampoos i m used to   i liked that  in that as the bottle began to drain it was still easy to get the product out  and i didn t have to stand there for 15 or 20 minutes for the product to ooze its way down to the spout bottom line  good product  that does exactly what it says it will  and smells great while doing it   yes  i will look for this when i go shopping  ,Positive
 i had high expectations for the remington   professional   hair dryer   the word   professional   implies that it will be of higher quality and also stronger in power   the only thing that seems   professional   about it is that it is heavier than my   non professional   revlon 1875 watts hair dryer  the handle is really heavy  however  this is a downside as it actually tired out my hands while i was holding it   the head of the dryer is made of regular  cheap  plastic so it is very head light   it doesn t feel at all balanced in your hand   one of my biggest criticisms about the dryer is the poor positioning of the toggle buttons   they are precisely where your fingers are while holding the hair dryer   i cannot tell you how many times i have accidentally changed the settings  it gets pretty frustrating my biggest criticism  however  is that it simply did not dry my hair  i have extremely thick hair and it takes a long time to dry it   again  i was hoping that a professional hair dryer might speed up the process   i ended up giving up after 5 solid minutes of using it on high   the ends of my hair were still dripping wet   my   non professional   revlon hair dryer does a much better job of drying my hair   i could have lived with its bad ergonomic design if it actually dried my hair   i think calling it a   professional   hair dryer is very misleading   it is an   ordinary   hair dryer at best  ,Negative
i love this  i used the reviews that recommended this & they were right  this stuff is great in the spa wax bath   love it    ,Positive
i ve been using this for about 3 months now  i have really fine thin hair that gets greasy super easily  this leaves my hair soft and completely tangle free without weighing my hair down or making it look greasy  my hair is a tiny bit oily by the end of the day but nothing noticeable  it makes it incredibly soft too  the smell is alright  defiantly mild  i also combine it with fx silk drops  couple dollars at walmart  and it s a 10 leave in spray  17 99 target  which are both a must  iv also noticed my hair never gets staticky since using this since it is the dry winter ,Positive
i bought this exact kit in bj s wholesale for 15 dollars because they had it on sell and also had a 5 dollar off coupon  i decided to try it because nexxus is a great brand and it s usually expensive  i have dry hair that breaks easily so it made sense to use this product  the issue to me is that the conditioner doesn t really hydrate your hair and the leave in treatment doesn t really smooth out my hair  i still get frizzies with it and my ends don t look any better  i won t be using this brand again ,Positive
 product works well and doesn t weight your hair down which is important if you have fine hair   which sadly  i do  i haven t noticed it giving my hair tons of volume but let s face it if you have fine hair it s only going to get so good  this product works well  leaves hair soft  and feeling healthy  ,Positive
 i am totally loving using the azure naturals products & i have no issue telling my friends about this great fine line wrinkle reducer & feel confident in putting this product on my skin  it does absorb in fast hydrating the skin & getting to work  i have been using it a short time but it goes so well using it right after the vitamin c serum  just pump out a small amount & a little goes a long way to giving your skin a youthful glow great for problem skin  evening skin tone & i had no rashes or issues with my sensitive skin  all big pluses non gmo is a very big deal to me as well & puts this product at the top of my list if you have wrinkles  age spots  uneven skin tone or even dry skin issues give this a try ,Positive
 too harsh for my hair   i bought this to try when i first started the curly girl method   i don t really like it  because it always leaves my hair feeling dry and coarse   i much prefer aloe or a lightweight conditioner for scalp cleansing  ,Negative
you can feel it wash out your pores  it basically feels as though your face is breathing  it s a cooling sensation as well  you feel it working  amazing product glad i tried it  make sure to moisturize after,Positive
 this shampoo from axe is advertised as a 2 in 1 shampoo plus conditioner product  designed to have a great   masculine   smell  clean  and condition all at the same time   the bottle is quite convenient  with a flip top lid and easy dispensing from the top   i ve used axe products before and am used to the general axe aroma   it is masculine but not heavy  quite an agreeable aroma for the hair   the odor lingers a bit but does not leave me smelling all day my one comment  and it is not a negative  is that the color is certainly not something found in nature   it is this wild blue turquoise shade that looks like it could be something radioactive that oozed from the local lab   it was quite cool actually   a nice part of the style as for performance  like any good 2 in 1  my hair is not quite as conditioned as if i used a separate conditioner  but it left my short hair manageable without needing the separate conditioner for every washing   recommended product  ,Positive
 i have been usingolay quench body wash  12 oz   i like it quite well  but i was running low and got the opportunity to try this product the dove body wash is slightly thicker than the olay  but it lathers just as well   it is unscented  like it says on the bottle    i ve had trouble with buying unscented products that smelled in the past    my skin isn t super sensitive   i get hives sometimes  but no eczema   so i can t comment much on that aspect of the product  but it hasn t irritated my skin   i do feel nicely moisturized after using the product this is your standard body wash   nothing sticks out to me about the product  but there are no drawbacks either  ,Negative
 when you read the label  it sounds like a great product  i just can t use it without it burning my eyes  it s sooo thick that it takes forever to rinse and even then i don t get it all because as soon as i open my eyes i can feel the burn   i even tried thinning it down with water  i thought that if it was thinner it would rinse away easier but that didn t help either  i can t use it   which is a shame because on principle i like alba products  ,Negative
 i stopped wearing makeup except for a bit of lipstick years ago  now that i m performing on stage  i m having to relearn the art and invest in new products and tools i already own several brushes by eco tools and i like them very much  they are easy to clean  comfortable in the hand and work well  they are also affordable this brush is an angled sponge and does a good job of blending foundation evenly  works great around the nose  forehead and jawline a useful tool to add to your cosmetic kit  ,Positive
 i thought this was pretty good  although it s very similar to their mineral concealer  but smoother   i really like the texture of it  it s pretty creamy and it s easy to blend  it s great as an under eye coverage but i haven t tried it on any other part of my face  so i m not sure about the chalkiness or mismatching undertones  until i find something that s totally amazing  i will buy this again  ,Positive
nice set    i would of given it a better rating but my caps came unglued to the applicator so it is difficult to open the gloss ,Positive
 due to pcos  polycystic ovarian syndrome   my hair has been thinning for years   now  it s not really at a point where other people might notice  but i do  and this stuff really makes it much thicker and gives me more confidence   i just sprinkle a little here and there and fluff it   my ponytail becomes instantly thicker and i can poof up the top and sides to give myself more volume   the one downside is that your hair won t be as shiny  i mean  it s like putting baby powder in your hair after all   but it does really thicken it   also  i thought maybe the powder would be evident  since it s white  but once you rub it in it disappears  ,Negative
 i have to say this is partially my fault as i had read the reviews but i went ahead a bought it  the cream did make my skin darker and i am still trying to fix it ,Negative
 panasonic beauty line  eh se60vp heated eyelash curler broke after the first use   it also made me fear that i would burn my eyeball   it did not do a good job of curling my eyelashes   if i could give this device   no   stars  i would   i hated this thing   please don t bother with it   it is useless  ,Negative
 i waited three months to give this product a fair shot  my skin did not peel to reveal new skin  my pores did not diminish  in fact it diminished the glow to my skin and dried it in spots  i will be returning to olay products and probably get a professional peel  ,Negative
i have been wanting these for a while and when i found them on amazon i was thrilled at the price  i have used them and they work exactly like they are supposed to  high quality and great price ,Positive
 thumbs up   i use the argan oil in my hair  especially on the dried ends  and it softens and conditions my hair overnight  you can use it during the day  but i usually use it at night as it goes on a bit greasy for my liking   although it does feel a bit greasy going on  it doesn t leave any trace of grease  just softness  i highly recommend using it in your hair right after you go swimming   i put it on my in my hair right after i am done swimming  and by the time i am home from the pool and i jump in the shower to wash my hair  the agran oil has done it s magic  and my hair is soft and smooth   i love it   i also love that the company has a 100% 100 day satisfaction guarantee policy   awesome because you can try this product risk free   and what s not to love about no added chemicals   don t forget to take a peak at their blog  they have a lot of great ideas on how to use argan oil besides just for your hair i received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using tomoson com  regardless  i only recommend products or services i use personally and believe will be good for my readers  ,Positive
 i have tried and reviewed several of motions new salon haircare products  i have 4a hair and need a lot of moisture  all the other products in this line bitterly disappointed me except this one  my hair shined  moved  and retained moisture all day long  plus  it is very light and my hair just drinks it in  i liked it so much that i also use it on my daughters thick  curly 3c 4a hair with great results  ,Positive
 i ve been using this product with my daily skin care  primary at night  this is the last thing i put on my face  i ve noticed a hugh change in my skin primarily around my eyes and smile  ,Positive
 i ve used aha products before and they ve worked very well for me  i am a month into using this one  and it does nothing  my skin shows no difference whatsoever  ,Negative
very nice   i like the smell and the way it makes my skin feel   will definitely recommend and probably repurchase ,Positive
i wonder how people give it a good review  this product increased my wrinkles and burnt my skin  the texture is good but the quality is bad  and the price is too much for the size  believe me please save your money  i bought both the eye and face cream and had to return them  both were bad quality ,Negative
 since i shave me head i gave this to the wife to use   to me it enhanced her natural red hair  made it more shinny and the little curl that she does have seemed to accent it more   the wife liked this product for the reasons i just listed  ,Negative
 yes  it s expensive but worth it   i love that it lights up when you look into the mirror and love how perfectly clear the reflection  the bad part of that is you see every blackhead and every pimple and every fuzzy hair  ,Positive
i got this in the pink as well as the gold and champagne and they are really fun to add a little sparkle to your regular makeup routine   i have been wearing the pink on my upper lid for the past few days and it really doesn t seem to stay on for the whole day   i wore it on the lower lash line and it seemed to just wear off and clump in little glitter pieces   it ended up looking like a little girl playing with kids makeup   just for a night out it is okay but it won t last for the whole day ,Negative
i order different ones and i guess they all come from china and are a waste of money   i had to throw these away also ,Negative
 i just got this mascara its great it crushes well the clump looks very natural good color great product would recommend to everyone ,Positive
 i ve gone through just about ever  flavor  of wen  i love the spring gardenia as it makes my hair soft and supple  i liked almond mint  winter cranberry and i really loved using summer mango coconut last summer  i also liked the aloe cucumber  i have yet to try lavender  but i will say that i did not like tee tree  fig or pomegranate  those last 3 make my hair end up feeling like straw  i can feel it as soon as i rinse my hair after using it  i even used one pump  as suggested by wen and other wen users  as a leave in conditioner  thinking that it would soften my hair up but after blow drying it comes out like straw every time  i hate it  my husband took a pix of the back of my hair and it was stiff like a broom  i will say that the tee tree does smell good and leaves a pleasant tingle on my scalp  but i detest the way it makes my hair feel  naturally  my hair is already a tad on the dry side  shoulder length and very fine  like i said before  the best one i ve used so far was spring gardenia  it is about the only one that leaves my hair soft  but i will say that i totally disagree with wen when they say they control frizz  because they do not  even when i do use that one pump as a leave in at the end  i still end up needing a bit of hairspray to calm the frizzies  some people would ask why i even bother with wen instead of regular shampoo    well  for me  it does make my hair feel clean even though it doesn t lather  i love the smell of it  it smells so clean and that lasts for hours  i managed to find the right one for me and should just stick with that  but i keep hoping that one of the ones i haven t tried yet will work even better than my favorite  i won t get another tee tree  but look forward to using the lavender i only gave one star to rate the product  not the seller  seller was timely and professional  ,Positive
 i am pretty disapointed in this product    it was recommended becuase i have lifting on the tips of my nails   at first i thought i was using too much bonder because i have read that too much can make lifting worse     after several process changes and careful application i still get lifting just at the tips    ive been using gelish products but wanted to go back to ibd becuase i like the consistancy of ibd gel    im now using gelish base gel and ibd pink  white  and clear over that and dont seem to have the lifting problem    ,Negative
this makes ur eyelashes look great yeah but they test on animals and i found this out after i ordered this  i shouldn t have ordered this ,Positive
 to be honest  i m not sure if this product is worth it  this shampoo in stuff is supposed to help extend the life of color  i tend to have more problems with hair growth and obvious roots  but my color certainly fades some too  so i was hoping this could help restore some life  i used in the shower as directed  and i m not sure that i m really getting much for results  i think maybe i see some brightening  but it s hard to tell  in other words  there may be some slight results  but if so  they re so subtle that it s hard for me to say for certain  given the subtlety  i can t say with honesty that it s worth the money  i was somewhat confused as to whether i was properly a cool blonde or a warm blonde  i tried both  and i can say that the results are subtle enough that it doesn t much matter if you choose one or the other note  i used both the warm blonde and cool blonde formulations  and had exactly the same results with both  ,Negative
 before i got this blow dryer  i had been using conair bb075w pro blackbird 2000 watt hair dryer   the thing i like about this one  though it is less wattage  at 1875  is that the opening is wider   more air   i like the fan  and the easy clean air filter setup better than my other one   yes  it is bulky  and bright red  but it has a hanging loop  a volume diffuser  and a smoothing concentrator you must have an acli safety device on your outlet   most places have them  but be sure so the dryer will shut off if there are any inconsistencies with the electrical current  or if the dryer gets accidentally immersed in water it has a limited 3 year warranty   you have to read the limitations  and you have to send in the warranty   there are no replaceable parts  so goody will replace a bad dryer if conditions are met it has a cool shot button  3 heat settings  2 air speeds  and a max speed button my hair got more curve to it with a round brush and diffuser   not together  separately   i do my bangs with a round brush  and then diffuse it   my other dryer didn t come with a diffuser  and i see it on sale at amazon for $6   not sure if it goes with black bird pro this dryer is ionic  ceramic  tourmaline  with a speed fan the downside is that there is a slight odd odor coming from the motor   i docked one star for that   i will update this if i have anything to worry about overall a nice blow dryer  in my opinion  ,Positive
 this would be something that casper or powder would use as it is super thick sunscreen that leaves you pale white   this is not a good sunscreen for fashion conscience beach goers as you ll look a bit silly  but i am pale and it protects me well  ,Positive
 been using parachute coconut hair oil since i was born  legacy of an indian mother  to keep my hair moisturized   i thought i d try this one for the scent  and lightness so i could use it during the day the scent is pretty and floral but not jasmine   the consistency is good to tame flyaways and moisturize your ends during the day  but be careful as a little goes a long way   however  for a deep treatment  i d stick with the original ,Negative
 to be honest i had never heard of emu oil before reviewing this product  but i am glad i did  while i am always nervous about adding oil to my already oily and broken oil face  this emu oil really surprised me  not only did in not clog my pores or break me out further  but it felt very lightweight on my skin  and absorbed quickly  i also felt it really helped my hair from feeling dry and frizzy from heat styling  i would recommend this oil to anyone for hair  and as a facial moisturizer for all skin types  ,Positive
 i am always on the lookout for a good hand lotion that doesn t leave me feeling greasy yet repels water  not an easy task  but this vaseline body lotion w  aloe come really close to achieving that goal smells great  soaks in within minutes and you are good to go  the bottle has a great push stopper that lets you easily dispense the amount you need without touching anything else other than the top of it i could feel this lotion start doing it s thing almost instantly  no allergic reactions  no stinging and no greasy residue a few minutes after application  after one week of use i have noticed a definite improvement in my chapped and cracked hands  it does have fragrance ingredients in the formula and for some that may be a deal breaker  otherwise you should have no issues   shop around for the best price  but the product itself is well worth seeking out good stuff  ,Positive
 even though this is made for african american hair  i thought it might help my husbands dry hair scalp  well  it totally coated his hair to the point of greasy  even using a small amount was way too much  the ingredients are very bad  first ingredient is petrolatum  this is a toxin made from petrol bi products  we will not be using this again  ,Negative
 gave this to my teenage son and let him go crazy  he loved the stuff and piled his hair high  very good hold with just a little needed  the   glue   washes out easily  nice light coconut scent  the bottle is thin and attractive  ,Positive
 i like the woodsy smell of this soap  and i feel i am protecting myself  nice tingly feel  rinses off and leaves you squeaky clean  no oily residue  but you must moisturize afterward  hope it helps in the battle against my recent attack of toe nail fungus  will update info later  ,Positive
product came on time and was packaged nicely =   love to use this comb after my shower with a little bit of leave in conditioner   my mom loves it too = ,Positive
 girl  it do clump honey this stuff clumps   the applicator is made for someone with gigantic eyeballs   it s completely straight and not curved at all   it s okay for the price though  ,Negative
 i have to start out saying i am caucasian   this product is made for african american hair   this is basically just a tub of vaseline   i am very disappointed because i got this after reading this was for dry scalps   in the winter my head gets very dry and i can only wash my hair every 5 days or so   but when i got this home and i saw the for natural or relaxed hair on the front i knew it wasn t for me   not only that but there are no directions as to how to use it this product just wasn t for me but was marketed like it was   i m disappointed because i would like a product like this but i have a tub of vaseline already at home so i don t need another one 2 stars because even though i didn t care for the product it did smell nice update i have been taking a very small amount  a petite pea size  and rubbing it into my scalp then shampooing it out and it has left my hair quite silking and manageable  ,Negative
 these schick hydro silk disposable come in 3 pack and have five blades that are sure to leave you ladies  legs silky smooth  these disposables have a moisture strip that is activated with water  but i still use shaving cream to avoid skin irritation  these are on the pricey side  they cost around $10 for 3 shavers  however  they are a good quality  not sure about anyone else but i will use them for a few shaves before tossing them in the trash  i will buy these in the future  especially if i can get a coupon lol   4 5 stars  ,Positive
i really love the suave professional line  i ve used all sorts of hair products out there from cheap to the more expensive lines and i have to say that the suave professionals is my go to brand the natural infusion line is a wonderful line that is enriched with natural ingredients  the awapuhi ginger and honeysuckle is a lightly fragranced conditioner  it is for anti breakage which is formulated for normal to fragile hair  i have dry hair but it is in a fragile condition since i sustained some damage from some over processing it works well and leave a clean yet conditioned feeling to my hair ,Positive
 i was really looking forward to use this  since a lot of youtubers love it  but unfortunately this broke me out and left my skin feeling sticky  my skin is not sensitive nor have i found a product that breaks me out  i guess there is a first time for everything   maybe is just my skin    so i wont purchase this again  ,Negative
really haven t seen a major difference and my expectations were not as high as i was hoping for   but it does feel light on the skin and not a bit sticky or heavy   i would buy it again just because it penetrates well into the skin without feeling tacky ,Negative
not impressed at all   it was no  different than the rest of the hydration hair masque i have used   not to much to say but it is not worth the cose ,Negative
this product is wonderful    i used it for the first time this morning and woah  my eyelashes were huge      i used a few coats but i always use many coats no matter what mascara  so far this was my favorite    i just got another package  mega plush volum  express i m going to try this right after i m done   but it s a little tiny bit runny it don t let that make you not buy it    i love it buy it now  ,Positive
if i could give a zero star to show how this is such a fake and not even a good fake   could not even give away    stinks    i had a real cabochard   don t waste your money,Negative
 we ordered these for our daughter for one of her christmas presents as she is really into doing different things with hair  we were greatly disappointed when we got these clips  upon receiving them  one was broken right out of the package and two had the black coating peeling off  a week after use one of the springs broke  these were very cheap and would not buy them again  ,Negative
this shade is really nice  i wore this on an interview and found it to be very appropriate for the setting  it s a little to princess y shade for me though ,Positive
 i really like sweet scents  but this one just didn t do it for me  i felt sick after taking a whiff a few times  it smells like a fruity shampoo at first  like herbal essences or something  but a few hours later  the smell is still lasting but smells different  like the fruitiness went away i think the original was way better and lasted longer  ,Negative
it is easy to apply and covers very well   i still have yet to experience removing the polish   this is day 2 and i expect it to last a lot longer   i am so pleased that i have since ordered 2 more colors and am delighted that there are so many to choose from ,Positive
 i tried this olay program during the winter and my skin became irritated  so i thought i d wait until some time had passed and my the cold winter winds and icy temps were making my skin more sensitive than normal no go   i tried it again and my skin felt itchy and uncomfortable   but to be entirely fair  i have quite a few allergies and have very sensitive skin   i can t even use baby oil on my face  ,Negative
i just dont like this stuff  maybe its too runny  it left my hair hard  i applied on dry hair ,Negative
 my esthetician recommended this product   i have combination oily skin and at 30 i break out like a teenager  i get black heads and deep acne pimples on my chin   prior to up until two years ago i had used proactive and it seemed to work great but either more hormones changed or i acclimated to it   so i began to break out again   since i ve been using this product my skin looks amazing   here s what she gave me and recommends 1   for really oily skin use in am and pm   use image spf 30 matte face cream in am   the matte will prevent breakouts 2  i use retinol mixed in with night cream in the evening   the retinol exfoliates skin and helps with fine lines and break outs 3  this is potent and can dry out skin   if your skin gets dry use only at night   also  you can apply image s vitamin c serum  which will restore your skin without breaking it out 4  use the mask as a spot treatment  honestly i use the aztec clay mask instead and that is awesome and super cheaper check that out on amazon   ,Positive
 i purposely ordered this foundation in a shade that is a bit too light for me  mainly because i wanted to mix it with my foundations that may be a bit too dark for me  i purchased the warm vanilla  i ve used it alone as well and its not cakey at all  sets well  doesn t break me out  ,Negative
i am very disappointed with this polish    i barely see the holographic effect in these   i am happy that i didn t pay full price for this because i would have been very upset ,Negative
 i wasted my two bucks   should have spent it on a vending machine   i tried to use it   it doesn t open right and when you pinch the lash  it s hard to apply  i would not recommend   needle nose tweezers would be better ,Negative
 this is the only dermalogica product i use  and might i say i love it  this product is the first step in demalogicas   two step   cleansing process  it helps remove all your make up and excess dirt  it is real greasy almost like baby oil so i was hesitant to use it at first  but it is fabulous at removing make up and even mascara  i wouldn t do without it  ,Positive
 i bought this product like months ago and forgot to do a review on this product  i used to like this tinted moisturiser especially for everyday use when i m going to school but now that i use a foundation i just abandoned this product  for me when using it with the sigma f80 flat top kabuki brush you can get a full coverage finish  but when using it with your hands you get a light to medium coverage  ,Negative
 please take this product off the market and redo it  what type of callus do you expect people to have  this is an embarassment because it doesn t work  i m glad i didn t recommend this to anyone as i was going to  i paid good money for a product i put in the garbage  that explains what type of product it is  doesn t it  ,Negative
 i have purchased this oil several times over the years and every time i get the same reaction  itchy and sore scalp   i read over the ingredients trying to figure out why my scalp reacts so badly to this oil because i have used the ingredients individually and i don t experience any negative reaction   it does make my hair soft but then again it just sits on my hair  never really absorbing into my hair   the smell is offensive to some but i grew up using sulfur 8 so this is not unusual for me   smells like a savory dish to me *shrugs*  to be honest  i would recommend that you purchase it at a local sally s store because they would let you return it if it doesn t work for you  ,Negative
 i received compliments on my   perfume   when i was using this   it smells simply wonderful   the problem is  it s an aerosol can of harsh  drying chemicals  regardless of what they re listing as ingredients  i found this to be very drying  ,Negative
 i love seche vite top coat for all the reasons that everyone mentions  specifically the beautiful finish and how quick it is to dry what i don t like is that some combinations of base coat  color  and seche vite seem to lead to my nail polish coming off in huge chips very early in my manicure the one i ve noticed is sally hansen quick dry base coat  opi nail polish  and seche vite   it will look fantastic  but then just chip in huge flakes from day two onward on the other hand  opi natural nail base  opi nail polish  and seche vite can give me 10 whole days of natural nail manicure  and sally hansen quick dry base coat  opi nail polish  and sally hansen quick dry top coat can give me 7 whole days of natural nail manicure so  if you love your seche vite you may have to match your base and nail polish to match it     ,Positive
brush snapped in half after less than two weeks of use   right where the handle joins the brush head   would not recommend ,Negative
 i can t say enough about this scrub  i use this in the shower because its nice to get a big glob and work it on to your face  it feels like its heating up on you skin  it feels wonderful  after you rinse it off  your skin feels jelly like     in a good way  it feels like you went to a spa  ,Positive
 it smells very good but why does it smell identical to australian gold sinfully black the tanning lotion is o k but i would not re purchased again  omg the bottle is super hard to squeeze out the lotion nearly impossible  the shipping was fast though arrived to kansas in 2 days  prime member i ve been tanning since i was 16 and i m 19 now and during that time i have used sooo many lotions such asworship me  tao  aphrodisiac  luminary  white 2 black  going gaga  sinfully black  paint it black  insanely black tingle  black storm  pure harmony  verture  berrylicious  sun skin spa  steamy conffesions  and some others i can t remember the names and if you want a great lotion please go for steamy confessions it will tan you like you ve been tanning next to the sun   ,Positive
tried using this for my eyebrows but it was way to light for my color  i m an african american and my eyebrows are black and i usually use a dark brown pencil but this was too light,Negative
 i liked the natural blush color that appeared when i applied this product  it didn t look at all like i used any blush  and the color produced was very close to my natural blush  i have a very light skinned asian complexion however  i noticed that about 1 5 hours later  the color disappeared and i wasn t even out in the sun it was nice while it lasted  but i wouldn t recommend it  ,Negative
i purchase the product based on the positive reviews  i love the smell and the smoothness but it didnt do anything for my wrinkles   i really was hoping for this to work but it just didnt for me  so i m off to search for other products to help with the newly forming wrinkles i m developing   ,Negative
 i received a tiny little bag  with maybe 70 tiny little square rhinestones yellow and clear in color    not what i ordered   these are not studs and not 3mm   such a waste of money   very very disappointed   bc i followed a link off of someone s youtube channel   this is not the product that was used in the video  or what s in the picture  ,Negative
i thought this would be a dupe for the beauty blender which costs $20  for just one   theses things feel like a tennis ball on my skin  they are not sponges these things are made out of rubber  use your fingers if you have to but don t buy this trash  on a side note i also have the mac sponge blender not as good as the real beauty blender,Negative
 all of us have various types of curls and we all need different products  my youngest has wispy  loose curls which products don t work well in  they are all too heavy in her hair  up till now i ve sufficed with a teeny  tiny amount of leave in conditioner in her hair when the occasion calls for pretty hair  but she always ends up with a wispy  untamed  frizzy look  this product eliminates that  it is very light  which works very well on her fine curls  her curls hold their shape very well for the majority of the day  it isn t sticky or hard  i use 1 pump per day  it is pretty inexpensive to start with and i see the bottle lasting quite a while  my daughter also loves the smell  this product does nothing for my curls and disappears into my eldest daughter s tight  frizzy  voluminous curls as though it had never been applied  no joke  so great for fine curls  but not good for thick hair  ,Positive
dear conair gel grips brush  where have you been all my life   i m not quite sure how i managed without you but i now know that i will never be able to survive without you again     for anyone reading this  i guess you can probably tell how much i adore this brush      ,Positive
 this is my moms favorite and only perfume she wears  it does go on strong   but the scent lasts all day m ,Positive
 great product for dry skin  i have eczema and use it when i need that extra skin boost  love it  ,Positive
 i have been using this for about 3 4 weeks and  while it smells nice  it has caused my skin to massively break out   it not foamy at all and feels more like a lotion going on   somehow though it still seemed to remove all the makeup from my skin  which was nice   the red  blotchy  pimply breakouts though are not nice  ,Negative
 i was buying this product before the ingredients changed  so i can tell the difference  it still works okay but i remember i loved both the orange scent and the moisture i felt before and after washing the product out   i won t be surprised if the ingredients change again since this brand use not so high quality of ingredients  sulfates  petrolatum  etc    so  i won t buy again  ,Negative
 this product did moisturize my face  but that s all it did  and i can do that with my standard moisturizer after four weeks of per instructions use  the wrinkles i was targeting  two above my upper lip  are as visible as they were when i started i may have noticed an exfoliating effect  but i m not sure whether what was coming off was skin or just dried product the product came out oddly  never fully mixed  there was clear  very thin fluid plus a thicker yellowish fluid  they were not mixed  the smell was also   off    almost like the odor of oil going rancid  ,Negative
 oh what a disappointment   the first three days of use were pretty good  then small break outs started to appear  and mind you  my skin doesn t freak out for no reason  if i punish it then yes it will revolt  and this 14 day torture system was certainly punishment to my pores  i must admit i never got to the face mask  i just couldn t do this horrible ritual anymore  i missed my nice face creams and soothed skin  this made it tight and dry then i would wake up to find clogged pores and random strange things on my face  this feels full of chemicals that are a harsh change from the beautiful creams i have been using since i m only 27 and there are no wrinkles yet i can t say how this works on wrinkles  but the lotion in them was strange and not pleasant and my skin literally felt unhappy each time i used it not to mention the breakouts  those were such a fun bonus     kasia s  ,Positive
 if you dress up a lot in costumes this is a great product for you  please ladies don t make yourself look like a crazy psychopathic bride of chuck doll wearing these thick  hard  plastic lashes  ,Negative
 as soon as you turn or twist them even a little bit  so annoying  every single one i ve used i ve had to pick out of my hair in two pieces  maybe i m being too aggressive with them  if you do want to buy them  maybe get a stress ball or something too  ,Negative
 i started using at home bkts this year after not relaxing my type 4b super coarse  super thick hair for four years  i originally started out with organix s kit with the excellent results  but the fact the it reddened my hair annoyed me and i was a little apprehensive of the ingredient list  i stumbled upon renpure website and decided to try out their treatment  it is relatively cheap  much cheaper than organix   i am very very pleased with results   i can apply it with my hands  i can use as much or as little as i want  and it doesn t discolor my hair at all  just smooth  shiny  manageable hair  i m sold  i really hope this catches on with black women who are looking for a safe  easy method to obtain straight hair  or anyone looking to super shiny smoothness to their hair  period   and i especially love the fact the it isn t permanent so i can go back to my natural hair texture whenever  i would advise anyone to try this  just be sure to use only sulfate and sodium free shampoos  aubrey s honeysuckle rose shampoo and conditioner is simply the best moisturizing combo out there  hands down   and be sure use a flat iron the reaches temps of 450 degrees  most important   also  renpure s argan oil products complement this excellently black women with super curly or kinky hair  who use dangerous chemicals such as lye on their it  which causes irreversible damage   try this  you won t be disappointed  i wasn t  ,Positive
this is seriously the best top coat i ve tried  i ve tried ones from sally hansen to opi and this is by the best one  it dries super fast  in 5 mins i m on the go  and it also leaves a super glossy touch to it  i m on day 5 right now and my nails still look freshly done   ,Positive
 i tried a lots of different product to find one which help my skin looks healthier  it seems &#34 the nature s best vitamin c serum&#34  is the one i was looking for  it helps skin to look firm  softer  younger and healthier and it s ingredients  reduce and reverse the aging process  ,Positive
 unless you cannot find an indian store  then it is ok  i do not like the price  it os overpriced  i found a store  i was lucky  where i was able to buy a five pound bag and it saved me a lot of money  at least the greys fade  it is not black  but it does not matter  as long the greys hide  i have used this before  and it worked pretty good  i just don t like the price  it is overpriced compared to the regular henna i have bought for more volume and a great price  ,Negative
 i know that this one is suppose to be for &#34 mineral&#34  foundation but i actually do prefer this one to my f80 for cream and liquid foundations as well  go figure  i mean don t get me wrong i love the f80 as well but if it s clean this is my first choice  every single time  i love it  ,Negative
really small in size  even with the % off from amazon i think i overpaid for a ok product ,Negative
 this lotions smells terrible  it s like burning rubber  used cooking oil  something chemically and dirty  i have sensitive skin so i ve used a lot of fragrance free lotions and all of them have a slight scent  but nothing nasty like this  ,Negative
       after using this for a short time  it s hard to tell if it works or not  but i was eager to try this product   i d seen it advertised on tv and it sounds good   it is light and nongreasy   i like it for those attributes   whether or not it will improve my skin probably won t be known for a time  but i m willing to give it a try   it does have an spf of 15 and that s always good  ,Negative
 i ve found that many deep conditioners don t feel all that different from regular conditioners  this certainly wasn t the case with the motions at home deep conditioner  the product was significantly heavier than many other conditioners i ve used  the heaviness didn t exactly appear to make a difference the heaviness actually makes this product significantly more annoying than one would expect  if your shower lacks a powerful nozzle  you ll likely run into trouble getting this out of your hair  conditioner should not be this tedious the other problem is that this product doesn t necessarily work better than any other deep conditioner  if the product isn t better than other deep conditioners  i can t really justify putting up with the problems that it causes  it may not cost a lot of money  but its certainly a cheap product  ,Negative
 although these are not my favorite color  they are nicely made  can hold a fair amount of products  and i found them very easy to cleanup  i am a no fuss kind of girl  so really  i need a product that performs as advertised  in this case holds and relatively protects my things  and when i say my things  i don t mean what s in the pouch  but what s in the bag that has the pouches  so far  it s been adequate in that regard  ,Positive
wonderful product & company  the shipping was fast & the product was amazing  this lash curler is a wonderful addition to my collection  as a beauty blogger i always look around for the newest most effective products & i have found something wonderful in izy trends lovely lashes curler  i recommend this for all women  you don t have to be extremely familiar with curlers to be able to use it  5 of 5 stars no doubt  i love it ,Positive
 this brush is a must have for long or short hair  straight or curly   the brush detangles and smoothes your hair after washing and works well on dry hair too   i have used a similar one that worked ok  but didn t have a handle and didn&#8217 t have long enough bristles  it just wasn t comfortable to use   but this hair tamer brush does tame the hair  the bristles are long enough that is goes to the root  which is great for long hair   the handle fits nicely in your hand and the brush itself is lightweight   it makes my hair feel so soft  love it  ,Positive
 unfortunately i didn t care for this protein   in spite of attempts to mix well  it remained gritty  and the french vanilla flavor was too sweet for my particular taste  ,Negative
i love doing designs on my nails and i have seen these tape stripes used many times   i just ordered them and i can t wait for them to arrive   it s going to take a few weeks because of where its shipping from but reading the reviews it seems like it often comes before estimated delivery date which is good   **tip   to prevent the tape from lifting from the sides of your nail make sure you cut it a little shorter than your nail s edge   cutting it over the edge or just at the edge will make it more prone to unwrapping   seal it in with a topcoat immediately after application   and it s recommended to apply on dry nail nail polish so that you can press it down with finger **  happy decorating  ,Positive
 i am so disappointed in this company  i ve ordered many times from them before and never had an issue until i received this shipment  first off  what they sent is a liquid  not a gel as they advertise here  also  the content is not bha  but simply rubbing alcohol  way to try to rip people off  skin laboratories  sneaking in some plain rubbing alcohol in your shipments hoping that some customers won t realize that this is not a real peel  not with me   i have done many bha peels before and i know what a true bha peel is  this is not   this is just rubbing alcohol  does absolutely nothing  returning the item today and will never order from this company again  you lost a loyal customer  ,Negative
 feria does not cover greys ver ell  which is what i wanted  it makes the hair very shiny  nice light color without too much red tones  ,Positive
i don t know if it is just me but i think this product smells a little like a wet dog    the smell really turned me off but it also made my hair sticky and tacky feeling   i haven t used it before this so i am wondering if it is expired or a bad batch ,Negative
great stuff  costs less than the department stores including walmart and target  by the way i am not bashing walmart  with today s economy have to shop with some sense ,Positive
so you want to take a nice long bike ride   you want to protect your self from the sun   so you grab your bottle of spf 30 and put some on your palms   you rub it on your arms and legs and face and then go to the garage to get your bike   wait   i ve got slipper stuff on my palms and now on my handle bars   if i m lucky i won t wreck my bike after sweating for a half hour   now with banana boat sport cool zone sunscreen continuous spray spf 30 i don t have that problem   all i do is spray on with no mess on my hands and get the bike and go   the spray is cool and refreshing   the spray is fast and easy and there is no mess   i suppose the only downside is how long will the product last and how expensive will it be   so far it still sprays and i use it when i m in a rush to get that ride before the rain   i like this product ,Positive
 i am so disappointed  i wanted something that would sooth  not break out my skin  as well as be a good spf  instead  this promptly caused a breakout  i did not use it in combination with anything else new  nor had i had any significant break outs in some time  so i feel comfortable saying this was the cause  ,Negative
 this works nicely  heats up quickly  very easy to use  it is lightweight and easy to handle  love that it comes with a locking option  took me a second to figure out how to do it though since it was so different than my previous flat iron  i can t call it salon quality  but it is much nicer than the one i owned prior  works well on my fine  wavy hair  i don t know if it would be a match for someone with thicker or curly hair though  ,Positive
great product ,Positive
 i have been using regenerist for about 8 years and i would not be without   you cannot beat the price at amazon   it s extremely effective for under the eye and i am told that i don t look my age  and regenerist is definitely one of the reasons for that  highly recommend this great product   amazon rocks  ,Positive
this concealer is one of the best i have used at such a good price  i am kind of a makeup snob who decided to give covergirl a try  it does cover well and you need very little product  i also use the corrector as i have a bluish pigment under my eyes  it covers wonderfully also with very little product  a must try for anyone trying to cover dark circles under their eyes ,Positive
this was too harsh for me  i tried both dry and wet brushing my face with it  i am even doubtful if it can be used wet  anyway did not work for me  however i have begun to use it on hands and feet which works well,Negative
 i have to be fair and say i like most shampoos   there are two issues that some do cause for me though  scalp dryness and stiff dry hair   this product on the other hand  left my hair soft yet workable and my scalp feels great   the scent is a pretty typical  mild and slightly sweet one  that could work for either sex   i like the way this rinses easily as well  and i find for myself  i don t need to use conditioner after every wash  so it saves me some time and money   great product  ,Positive
giovanni invigorating tttt conditioner is one of my favorite products  it does what it claims to do and uses organic ingredients   i love the smell and feel of it   it leaves my hair soft and nourished   i feel better using organic than department store conditioners as the list of ingredients sounds so much healthier ,Positive
 i bought this for stamping along with white and silver and i didn t like how this one worked at all  its not really the right consistency for stamping despite being called &#34 special nail art stamping polish &#34  the black  silver  and white all work  i actually went back and ordered a bottle of black after liking the white and the silver so its not the brand  its this specific color because when it comes to the silver glitter i was disappointed  it didn t show well  if you want a glittery look i liked harp on it by color club  its a holographic and it works great for stamping   ,Negative
 everyone said this brush dryer is so great    but i am finding it hard to work with and very noisy   it heats up well but the spin speed goes too fast    i find it hard to control and it just grabs my hair  in theory  this is a good idea   i am not sure it works in reality   i may have to return this  ,Positive
i love essie nail polish and new unusual colors   this is one color i had to toss  evan my daughter wouldn t wear it ,Positive
 3 pack color coded  so family members will not confuse which one is hers his  this is a new product to us that we started to like  it is very hard to reach your back unless you have a back brush  back brush can lather your back but not these towels can also give you a rub to remove dead skin cells  the towel is long enough to hold on each end and rub it on your back  it also reach parts of your back that itches which makes dual purpose after use  i pat it on a terry towel to remove water  this way it doesn t get soggy or prevent the growth of germs a sample of this product was sent to me for review purposes  ,Negative
 i m pretty pleased with this shampoo conditioner combo  the anti dandruff properties seem to work well  at least as well as head and shoulders  but unlike other dandruff shampoos it does not leave my hair dry  it lathers well and rinses easily my only quibble is the scent  it s just ok   not objectionable  but it is a bit more medicinal than i care for  not enough to warrant detracting a star  however  ,Positive
 i am cursed with very fine hair  that is now also thinning as i get older  i am always dubious of products that make grand promises  but had not tried a   scalp conditioner   before  so thought i d give it a try  first  the smell of this product is wonderful  but may be overpowering if you are using it with other scented products  the product itself is very thick and a small amount goes a long way  directions state to shampoo  then gently massage this product into your scalp and hair  then rinse  the product takes a long time to rinse out thoroughly  all that said  i do notice  just 7 days from starting to use this product  that my hair feels stronger and my scalp itches far less  i do not have dandruff  just a few   itchy   spots on my scalp  and this has been cut down noticeably  immediately after use my hair is left very soft and very shiny i will continue to use this product as it seems to do what it promises  and i enjoy the scent as well as the results of shiny hair and less itchy scalp  it s all good  ,Positive
 when i use this  my hair is really bouncy and volumous and suuper shiny and straight  and what s weird is it doesn t feel greasy at all  even the day after  the smell is amazing too  the only thing is i have to use a lot of this to get good results  i have highlighted medium length hair that is fairly thick  and i have to use 3 4 whole pumps  but its still a great value  the bottle is small but it will last soo long  ,Positive
 did not work well on my hair i have dry  relaxed hair and this did nothing to help it become softer  ,Negative
 my daughter really only likes the long ones but her friends like the short ones too   soooooo easy to put in and you can wash your hair  curl it  everything without worrying about ruining it   if you are careful when you remove the little metal things you can even use them again  ,Positive
 i ordered this brush from amazon because my local retailers didn t have it in stock  my order arrived promptly and the brush is amazing  it s soft  easy to hold  and does a great job applying color  the bristles don t seem to fray like on less expensive brushes  which means i ll be using it for a while  i would definitely recommend this brush to anyone  ,Positive
solar oil is a must have for the care of your cuticles  the bottle is huge and the smell is like fresh almonds  it glides on like a polish and then you rub it gently around the rest  of your entire nail bed  must have for the long winter months&#10084 ,Positive
it broke the before i got it over my head  you get what you pay for  it looked so cute but it is so tight it will break and is unfixable or will give you headache ,Negative
 i had been using the divacup for a while and had a lot of success with it  but when i lost it a friend  gave me a pack of the softcups she had used once and didn t like  i thought since i had liked the other brand this would be much the same way    it wasn t i don t know how many times i tried to readjust things and try different angles or higher lower inside the vaginal walls  i couldn t stop the cup from leaking  it wasn t horrible  but it was enough to ruin a couple of pairs of panties which ensured that i wasn t saving money on this alternative item and that i won t be using the brand again  it was an utter disappointment    i d say try another brand instead like divacup or lunette  i had good experiences with both  ,Negative
 okay  where do i start and where or goodness is the nearest circus in town   not only is this jumbo  it s got to be a joke cause no one needs a bonnet this size unless they are wearing a triple threat bouffant hair do   if your hair is long then just wear a snood or pin your hair up   really   and i think if the fabric were silky smooth on this particular bonnet then it would make sense for some to have a bonnet this size   but the fabric is stiff wrinkly  and hard   run for the barnum and bailey circus i say   all this model needs are floppy ears to wear with her bonnet   lol ,Negative
perfect for my needs ,Positive
 paul mitchell did not disappoint with this product  of course paul mitchell rarely disappoints me  the spray has a wonderful smell  sprays well  & helps to make my hair wavy  i have a few favorite sea spray hair products  but this has moved to my number one favorite  why  because this gives my hair body and doesn t leave my hair with any crunch   i have straight hair too   eager to now try more of the awapuhi wild ginger line  ,Positive
it s a little bit dry after i used this masque  guess better not use it too often  1 time per week will be fine ,Positive
 i don t understand all of the rave reviews  this product settled into all of my pores and lines and look really cakey and gross not flattering  also  the colors are off  it took three purchases to get the right color never had this trouble before  i am not impressed  ,Negative
 argan oil is a great moisturizer  it is useful in many ways  i have to say i m probably biased  but my girlfriend uses this and she glows and is absolutely stunning  i d recommend argan oil  carefully though   ,Positive
 you couldn t ask for more    great price  great colors  something for everyone   and you can leave it matte or just put a shine top coat to make it look glossy   the package arrived fast    no damages  i ve already used 5 of the colors  they dry fast and are great as a base for stamping or water marbling  too  ,Positive
 suave products are a reliable  economical option for hair care   i have used their products for years and always been happy   this leave in foam is no exception   after washing and towel dry i put about three pumps into my hand and ran it through my hair   it has a light  pleasant scent that does not overpower   i leave my hair to air dry and the foam gives body without leaving any residue  it holds my curls well and i can use a little more on my dry hair to tame any fly aways   very pleased with this product and will definitely purchase in the future  ,Positive
i use this in the a m  when i am usually in a hurry to get to work    a couple of strokes to the eyebrows and you are set all day   would purchase again ,Positive
 this is not a moisturizer  if that s what you are looking for  than don t buy this product  what it does do is create an amazing dewy glow on your skin  that doesn t look like glitter or fake  it makes your skin look amazing for pictures if you have a special event coming up  i used to use this all the time in college when we would go out on the town and i was showing some skin  i just ordered this to use on my wedding day to get that dewy glow for pictures  this also leaves your skin feeling silky soft  though it more of a i just applied mineral oil to my skin sort of way  it doesn t really moisturize  like i said before   ,Negative
favorite lip gloss ever  you must buy this  best nude color   not too sticky  i wear it over any every lip stick loooooove it ,Positive
 it s gentle and non drying without tightening the skin  but yet removes mascara   i ve used many cleansers including some expensive ones  but this may be the best yet  i don t have to worry about having dry patches on my face after a few days use with this cleanser  i will definitely continue to  purchase this product  ,Positive
 i have been using bare minerals for years   i am so glad the blush comes in a pressed powder  no more mess i don t use the included brush  but love the color and the quality  ,Positive
i have really damaged hair and this didn t help it one bit  maybe you need some silocone in your hair sometimes just to be able to get a brush through it  my hair felt dry after using this product ,Negative
 it works better than most concealers i ve used  and i don t get that clumped feeling on my eyelids when using it  it goes on smooth  and people tell i looked refreshed when using it  i d purchase it again  ,Positive
 my hair is short  straight and fine so drying time  unfortunately   what i wouldn t give for fantastic hair  has never been an issue with me  on that basis  i don t know that i m qualified to review the finer points of a hand held hair dryer and hence can only comment on its features and whether or not it does what it s supposed to do the remington d 2012 salon quality ceramic hair dryer  with tourmaline  positions itself on its packaging against another dryer in the same price range  which i don t happen to own   it includes a concentrator and a diffuser  neither of which i have reason to use  not unlike just about every other hand held dryer on the market  it adjusts for both airflow and temperature  its claim is that its ac motor lasts longer than dc motors  i have no means of verifying this  to be honest  i don t use the remington d 2012 all that often because i keep it at my parents  house so that i don t have to travel with a dryer when i visit  however  it does a good job for me and even though it seems a tad flimsier than my other dryer  hence the one star demerit   i can recommend it regardless  ,Positive
 ecotools  skin perfecting brush  this is the first time i have heard of this company but i like their attitude toward caring for our planet indeed yes  there are brushes you can purchase which are comprised of animal hair  such as sable make up brushes  brushes made of boar s hair  and so on however  even if you are not vegan  not a member of peta  not an animal lover  and maybe you just don t care about anything at all except your makeup  i am not here to judge you i am here to tell you this is a good  inexpensive  nice brush to use to assist you in applying your bb creme  i use this every time i apply mine    or to use as a blush brush to shape the contours of that stunning visage of yours i like this ecotools skin perfecting brush   i hope you do too incidentally  i am not a member of peta  and i am not vegan  but i have been a vegetarian for 9 years and if i had the guts i would be a vegan   for health reasons as much as anything else i like to think that one tiny step at a time we will recover our dear planet  it is more complicated than a makeup brush  for sure  but that is a start thanks jean ,Positive
 i had high hopes for this given the average rating and reviews  but for me this did absolutely nothing  my mother bought it and neither of us had any results  definitely not worth the money  would not use even for free  ,Negative
i love the rubber grip on this tool  it makes it easier to grip when pushing back cuticles  very sturdy as well and reasonable cost ,Positive
 it made my hair sticky and hard i didn t like it  also it smells like chemicals and made my hair feel stiff  i originally bought it because i got this waver for my hair and thought i should get a protectant spray for the heat  well it didn t work my hair got kind of frizzy  then again my hair gets frizzy easily  and is sensitive i guess so maybe it just wasn t for my hair type  i know lots of other people think it s amazing so i don t know  not for me though  total waste of 8 bucks and shipping was forever    ,Negative
 i inadvertently ordered two vitamin c serums  and i m glad i did   this is so watery it s difficult to apply   the other one i got was a true serum  not water    i would not recommend this to anyone to buy  ,Negative
i use this over the more expensive ones  the color is natural and develops quickly  smells better than any other one i have tried ,Positive
 when it came in the mail  i just tried it   could not use the &#34 pro  brush that it comes with it  because it doesn t work   in less of hlf an hour i looked like a raccoon  it smudge all over my face  it is really cheap but it also doesn t work  save your $2  ,Negative
 when collagen breaks down  peptides are released into the dermis   peptides signal the dermal system to produce more collagen   this product  with four peptides  seems promising at first glance   after all  if we can improve collagen production  we re protecting the structure of our skin there are many products that contain peptides on the market   fytofontana promises results because this product contains not only a variety of peptides  but several other ingredients  like retinol  sodium hyaluronate  and phospholipids   beyond these considerations  there are a number of shortcomings to consider the first problem is dispensing the product   the cap must be pumped and removed so you can dispense the product from a pipette   two problems here   what if you knock over the bottle and spill the product   and the bottle is not opaque   exposure to air and light diminish the efficacy of retinol second  this product contains a lot of fragrance in the form of perfume and essential oils   this will certainly cause problems for many users  experienced as irritation or allergic reaction because there are many serums available that do contain peptides and the other beneficial ingredients mentioned that have opaque  airtight packaging  i do not recommend this serum   i have used it for several weeks with no improvement in the appearance of my skin   this could have been a contender  but it isn t  ,Negative
this set has many different colors and shapes which makes it so much more fun when i do my hands and feet  i opted to quit the salons for a while as i am having fun doing my own nails ,Positive
the main reson why i ordered it was because of the black     like on the picture    and black is not even in it,Negative
i love  this color with  most of my other opi colors that i use it on  stays on for a long time too ,Positive
good price for a nice brush  i bought two and i m glad i did  i use one for my jane iredale mineral base and the other for a bronzer brush ,Positive
upon ordering this i was expecting the polish to be black or in that close proximity but instead is a dark plum purple color  i love the color its just not what i was expecting  besides the color confusion the gelish polishes are wonderful as always  great product & would recommend to everyone ,Positive
darkest brown was more of a light brown  it did not give me the look that i was looking for  very disappointed ,Negative
 like other reviewers  i had tried these in the past  and recently gave them another shot the biore deep cleansing pore strips will pull small blackheads out of your nose and forehead  but they seem to only work for specific types  not blackhead that are too large or too small  and the black head have to be visible on the surface on your nose  you could probably get a better result by squeezing than in putting these strips on your wet nose and waiting around for 15 minutes  also  if you wait too long  it s harsh on your skin to peel off  and if you pull too soon  they don t work the nose strips are considerably more effective than the forehead ones    at least for my face  ,Negative
 these are not nail art paints  so don t be fooled  they are  literally  fabric puff paints with the labels taken off and a silver &#34 nail art&#34  sticker stuck on   the paint will peel off your nails within an hour or so of them being dry  even with a top coat  these were not made for nail art  don t waste your money   thankfully the seller i used felt bad and refunded my money  as well as removing this product from their inventory completely   i suggest all sellers do the same and let the fabric paint people have them      ,Negative
 all i can say is  if you do as the directions state  your nails will grow and become stronger  i use this as my base coat for every mani that i do now  it became the miracle cure for my weak  brittle  peeling  breaking nails  i haven t had a problem since  love it  ,Positive
 i have bought this product quite a few times  i wear sunscreen every day  but i also suffer from oily  acne prone skin  this sunscreen is truly the best  it goes on smoothly  and it leaves no shine behind at all  i do not believe i have ever broken out from this sunscreen  plus  makeup goes on top of it perfectly   it works just as well as any other moisturizer under makeup  and it protects from the sun well  i put this on my face and my boyfriend s during an all day music festival in the dead of summer  it was 97 degrees that day  and neither of us got sun burnt  we reapplied often of course   ,Positive
 these are one of the biggest staples in my beauty routine  i use them primarily for removing eye makeup  and for using toner  but i also use them to wipe off makeup brushes between uses  i have these auto delivered as i literally go through one of these packets every two weeks  but they are versatile  soft  and do not cause any issues with my skin  better than cotton balls for me  ,Positive
love this shower gel  it s so good at softening the skin and the smell is delightful  it smells sooooooooooooo good and clean  i absolutely love soap and glory products  love this shower gel forever ,Positive
don t waste your money on this   there are better products and i would order this again  look up illuminesce dmae on amazon ,Negative
 this stuff is super thick and in a bad way  it has no slip whatsoever  so it s thick and goopey and doesn t spread easily at all  it also has a strong  annoying scent  and did not effectively moisturize my thick  coily aa hair  i would not recommend  ,Negative
 i resisted trying white diamonds for years  certain it was dreadful because  a  it s inexpensive and  b  even back in 1991  the first ads showed a silver haired liz with various middle aged lovers  i absolutely despise the cloying red door  of similar vintage and price point    and i unfairly lumped wd in the same category  how wrong i was  this is a beautiful  classic white floral chypre  easy to wear and love  it does start out with a pretty bold blast of multiple white flowers  but the fizzy fresh aldehydes and woods keep the flowers from turning rotten  as wd wears on  it is soft and clean and yet strong in character  the florals stick around until the end  but are pretty rather than overwhelming  reminds me quite a bit of chanel no 5  but brighter  less formal and more versatile  this stuff is classy and distinctive and i am a big fan  ,Positive
this item was a disappointment   the colors i received were hideous   the towels themselves were not absorbent at all   these will be used as garage rags   don t waste your money ,Negative
 this product is hard to find on shelves in my area  on the rare occasion i or my mom would see it we would buy up like 3 bottles at a time  i have just started buying it on amazon instead  i love that it absorbs quickly and doesn t leave my hands greasy  i hate having greasy hands  but still leaves my hands feeling soft and moisturized  the scent is light and pleasant  similar to the scent of the other aveeno products  i ll also use it on my legs after shaving and on any other dry itchy patches i might have on my skin and the oatmeal in it really does seem to help calm the itching  ,Positive
the picture shows tiny bristle brushes and that is not what you get  they are much bigger  so was not happy with purchase ,Positive
it do the job but i wish it came with instructions on how to insert the bids in   i almost messed it up loool i took something to make the lil hole to insert the bid bigger   im glad i stopped and didnt keep messing it up   in the end i figure it out and it was my mistake but it works totally fine  just press the little silver button and unscrew the other silver thing where you insert the bids and the little hole will get bigger  just insert and screw close again  done  ,Positive
this is way to shiney for me and there is no way to tone the shimmer down  it s a very adolescent color if that makes sense  it looks like a teenage girl color or play make up  wouldn t buy again  the shimmer settles in the fine lines that noone wants to be noticed  pass,Negative
 i have worn this lipcolor for many years   love it   they stopped making this spicy beige color and i m glad you have it available online   i purchased 2 so far   today i bought the last 1 available   it does last a long time  so when i go back to purchase again in the store  they stop making it and i have to go online to covergirl to see what the newest color is that is to work best w  my color   i have found this color to be perfect for me  before i found it online  i tried at least 5 or more diff colors in the store  its so frustrating they change the colors so often   your lips get dry during the day  and that is why they make the clear coat that comes w  it  you can also use chapstick like i do   i drink water all day and i hate to have a glossy lip print on my cup  so i tend to wear my chapstick instead of the clear coat thanks for making this available  ,Positive
i was really excited to try  this  i have become obsessed with anything nail related  i played with  this for about 2 hours before settling on a design  and i love the different plates there are so many options  ,Positive
it has been my experience with sensitive skin that collagen agravates it and causes breakouts  have learned the hard way to avoid it ,Negative
i have been using this on my face for about a week now and love how it makes my skin feel silky and soft and it is non drying,Positive
 i read that last review  well  if you don t want a long lasting matte lipstick don t buy this i doesn t smell either  i am in my early 60 s so creamy n glossy r things of the past my favorite matte lipstick is mac but it cost round $17 00   i have been quite happy with this product does everything my mac does n cost much less  ,Positive
i would like my money back this  is a poor nail tip i have had to reform many clients  loosing  money is not the name of my game   very upset with this productafter applying tips  on several  clients each back with easily broken nails  the pinky  nail would always crack when cutting down to size  not good at all  i ended up doing double work and lost lots of money and clientsn so dissatisfied      ,Negative
they dont work,Negative
 suave professionals gradual self tanner is one of the best self tanning lotions i ve used   the scent wasn t too strong  and it was absorbed into my skin evenly   the tan color that resulted was natural looking  not at all  orangey   i m satisfied with this product and plan to use it throughout the summer for a nice glow  ,Positive
had problems with it my eyes swelled up,Negative
 i can see the unilever marketing machine at work  with so many positive reviews of this series of moisturizers   i tried all 3 because they are cheap compared to the products i buy from department store  i e   lab series   you do get what you pay for and these products are crap   these moisturizers are so basic  they are no known advanced ingredients to provide any anti aging or skin repairing benefits   they also don t provide sufficient moisture for combination skin   and why does dove add fragrance to a product for sensitive skin when it is scientifically established fragrance is a top skin irritant if you are willing to spend more  department stores offer far better and far more advanced products like lab series   if your budget restrict you to drugstore products  then there still better choices such as neutrogena for men  or just olay products  though not grey color containers this line of dove products are so underwhelming  it s embarrassing by today s standard  ,Negative
wish they has this color first since i ended up with a plain black one that im gonna have to either donate or fill with more plates  very decent quality you can even double up on each pocket without worry,Negative
 the expensive one i purchased at sally s fell apart after several years so i had to replace it   this looked similar but it is not like the one i purchased a few years ago   this is made of very cheap thin aluminum and i can t get the pieces together   it comes with 2 screws but the holes are not large enough to screw in so maybe heman can come and put this together for me   it s a cheap piece of crap lol   all of that could be forgiven but when i put my hair dryer in it  the whole thing tips over   it s not the base that is the problem it s the &#34 flexible hose&#34  part is not strong enough    i really need to start reading these reviews     ,Negative
 i had extremely damaged hair i was babying along with revlon butter treat  it was looking pretty decent as it was growing out   then i bought and tried redken cat   this product did more to damage my hair than anything i ve tried on it   i feel it stripped both moisture and color from my hair and left me with straw like lifeless frizz and so much breakage i needed a haircut after using it  maybe if your hair was in good shape to begin with it could handle cat and actually be improved  but my experience is  buy this   and give it to your enemies  ,Negative
 the images on this plate are neat designs and the size is perfect   it arrived packaged well and the blue plastic removes from the plate easily   but   the images are not etched deep enough   i cannot get them to work   i ve tried using different polishes  konad and regular   i ve tried using different stampers and scrapers   i ve tried scraping at different angles and scraping from different directions across the image   i tried each image multiple times  and have only been able to get 1 of the images to transfer to the stamper   i like the images and really want these to work  so i will keep trying and hope i can find a way to make them work  ,Negative
i ve been using this about 4 times a week for a month and i have seen no difference  i use it on my knees and other darker areas of my body and there is no change  it smells good but it leaves your skin feeling rigid and hard and not smooth or soft  it s alright just as a normal soap but it s useless as a skin lightning soap ,Positive
 although i ve only had my flat iron one day  i could not be happier  i used it yesterday and my hair this morning is still shiny and straight  it heats up faster than any other flat iron i ve had and leaves hair as shiny as those commercials  about hair products  you see on tv  it might be too soon to review this product  but i m so happy with the results that i could not wait    ,Positive
 this is everything an eyeliner should be  dark in one application  creamy  easy to work with and long lasting  i ve repurchased this item  i can still use my old one  although it has dried up a bit  purchased two years ago   i find it easier to use with an angled eyeliner brush  but the tiny brush it comes with is also workable  just make sure not to load it too much  otherwise you ll get no color from the tip of the brush and two parallel black lines from the edges  i have super watery eyes and it times  after extended wear  it can smudge a little bit under the eye  but nothing dramatic  i ll keep buying this  ,Positive
 this does not work for a beginner  maybe user error  but i was extremely disappointed leaves my face red  nearly scarred  and doesn t get out hard to reach blackheads also  took weeks to deliver  ,Negative
 i love this product for everyday coverage   it gives a natural  dewy finish   it is easy to apply and blend into the skin   perfect for this mom on the go to slap on after the gym   i can t even feel it on my skin  but it gives me confidence that my skin looks great   my favorite makeup product  ,Positive
 what s the second ingredient in dr  perricone s super detox elixir  what s the second ingredient in murad clarifying toner   what s the second ingredient in olek henriksen grease relief face tonic   i could go on and on     but i ll just let you know  it s witch hazel  which you can find in your local pharmacy for a few bucks   is a great astringent  and its one in its purest form what is witch hazel  it is the leaves and bark of the north american shrub known as hamamelis virginiana  sometimes you might see this on a label as an ingredient in your favorite toner or astringent instead of the words   witch hazel      witch hazel naturally grows in nova scotia in canada  and florida in the united states witch hazel can be used for so many things but using it as your daily astringent can not only give you great skin but also a lot of bang for your buck  in addition  witch hazel is an herbal and natural product and thus it is great for sensitive skin  you can apply it after shaving  waxing and any kind of skin care regimen there is a reason you can find witch hazel in so many skin care products   it has so many benefits  it reduces excess sweating and oil secretion  helps with large pores  treats acne  and helps with various other skin conditions   the astringent also has anti inflammatory properties  if you have ever had a facial  you will notice that usually after extractions  your aesthetician will apply with hazel to your skin  witch hazel can also help prevent the development of acne as well as treat existing acne and pimples  this is the reason why it is frequently used in acne skin care products another approach for using witch hazel astringent is treating psoriasis  dermatitis  eczema  diaper rash and poison ivy rash in the natural way  witch hazel is also one of the best herbal remedies for alleviating sunburns and windburns and the best part is that you can pick it up at your local pharmacy for about five bucks  hope you enjoyed this skincents tip  for more tips and reviews visit pimples and wrinkles  and look out for the launch of our new site this month which will feature product reviews  treatment reviews and spa reviews  see you at pimples and wrinkles  ,Negative
 they look really fake  unlike other nails and they are wide  i m not sure if it s the material used  but i don t like it  ,Negative
 its blush  i do like how loreal matches their line with a number system  that s my favorite thing with these  otherwise  its pretty typical ,Negative
 1 3 of my containers might as well be empty  literally  2 of the 12 are half full the rest are under 1 4   4 of which i coukd count the tiny beads by looking through the lid disappointed to say the least expect teeny tiny beads   the pics are right but are taken up clise so perception may be thry are bigger than the actual size i received   black  looks great but virtually empty so its useless to me  silver  as above  gold  as above  metallic purple  looks good and have half a container  metallic fuschia  as above  pale pink pearl  looks ok at best but barely 1 4 full  metallic dark pink  as above  metallic red  as above  multi color  looks kinda terrible and is virtually empty  pale yellow  looks ugh and is under 1 4 full  pale turquoise  as above  turquoise  looks ok but under 1 4 fullall in all this was a waste of time and money  i think i would rather pay a little more and receive a product i can use  ,Negative
 i use this product every day after my shower   so far it has had a wonderful effect on my skin   moisturizing and clean feeling  i really love dove men+care products it is a light formula  so you do not feel greasy   the lightness also carries into the smell  which is light and masculine i feel like my skin has gotten better with regular use   my skin is not dry or greasy   it is actually getting less sensitive  or so it feels i highly recommend this product for men looking for a great daily moisturizer  ,Positive
it s my second eye cream and i love it  the texture is thick and the smell    you have to get used to though works really well  i m still in my 20s and bought this for my dark and puffy eye circles ,Positive
i love this product it is a great way to keep the face looking shiny and young  i love it ,Positive
 i was so hopeful about this product since i like many eminence products  the product removes makeup well  however  it is too soapy for me and suds up a bit  i do not like the smell  it reminds me of the white shoe polish i used on my moccasins back in  86  it also stings my eyes  i will not purchase again  for now i will remove my eye makeup with a product i love  vichy purete thermale 3 in 1 calming cleansing solution  then use the eminence to remove the makeup on the rest of my face  i do like the dispenser  ,Positive
 i used it for several times on my stomach  but it hurts my skin even with body wash on  maybe i have use it a little longer but i can t stand the pain so it s my daughter s toy now  ,Negative
 i have very fair skin  this product worked great on my legs  it was very subtle though i like my self tanner a little darker  it was easy to apply and wash off   and dried fast  no irritation at all  i tried on my arms but the inside of my arms  even with letting it dry for over 30 min hardly moving came off faster over all a great self tanner  other brands have worked better for me but this worked nice on my legs ,Positive
 its true  you get what you pay for  this is not the original beaut blender  its tough and hard  so you pound your foundation into your face   its less then pleasant  but it was cheap so it didn t hurt to try and see    at least i m not out anything     ,Negative
 yes  it blurs  but my face felt and looked like i was a madame tussaud wax figure  i don t usually wear anything but moisturizer so maybe that s why  ,Negative
 i bought this product despite the reviews because it was cheap and i wanted to try dry shampoo  i also bought the dove dry shampoo at the same time good  not an overwhelming but pleasant odor  the texture of my hair was if i sprayed light hair spray on it  got rid of all grease  gave my hair body bad  i have medium brown hair  i followed the directions and sprayed my hair approx 8 inches away  i used very little and went on my hair white  i brushed it as recommended but it did not go away  it made my hair look white gray and i was so embarrassed i had to wash it  i would not recommend this to anyone with dark hair  i am terribly disappointed  but for about $3 i guess i should have expected it the dove dry shampoo works much better and it s just a few dollars more  ,Negative
 i have my share of spots and acne scars  and am on the lookout for a little help in fading those  i ve tried pricier products  and the only thing that faded from those was my cash flow  this isn t bad  in the $20 range  and using it for a couple of weeks  i already see a bit of fading and more even skin tone  i m very happy with the product  and also like the texture  not too greasy  but just like a nice moisturizer  and that it s not really scented  i look forward to seeing how my skin looks in two  four  six weeks down the road  i definitely plan to buy more once i run out  ,Positive
 this product works well for me in terms of hold but it makes your hair look dirty and dry all day and a bit gross overall also  the scent is a bit too perfume like and too strong as well  ,Positive
 this works much better than i expected   my husband has thinning hair right on the crown of his head   i sprinkled some of the powder on his shining scalp and well  first off  we noticed the color was all wrong   he really needed maybe the grey and blonde mixed  because his hair is blonde turning grey  so it looked like he had a sunny shiny spot on the back of his head   if he really cared about his balding head  i would get both kinds and put the grey on last  and i think it would work better the color is just so monochromatic that it doesn t look as natural as i wish it did   it is a fairly pale  rather neutral blonde it does the job of covering though   it didn t take much   the container looks rather small but it only took a few shakes to cover him  so there s several applications in the container   he has just a bit of hair in that area  but it covered it well so his scalp no longer showed   they stuck too   it says to use hairspray but he wouldn t let me do that to him  but it s been several hours at work  with a ball cap on and off  and i still can t see his scalp i d say if you are concerned about hair loss  definitely give these a try  especially if your hair is fairly evenly shaded   if not  it might be worth it to you to try to blend 2 shades  ,Negative
needs to have the hair spaced out more  i don t know why they insist over putting the hair so tight  you can easily see the band ,Negative
 a classmate had originally given me a set for free   i love that they have a variety of sizes to fit big  medium  and the smallest brushes  eyeliner and brow brushes    they are also stiff so it sits up nicely in a cup or i slant it on a towel when i dry my brushes   aside from the free set i got  i also purchased one with only small sized brushed guards because i have a lot of eyeshadow brushes  as well as a multi sized set   i also bought the cleaning kit which came with more brush guards   i would highly recommend it for anyone who has a lot or a few makeup brushes  ,Positive
 the product arrived very quickly and neatly packaged  i found it worked mostly on bags around the eyes  i loved the smell and this serum is not sticky to the touch  great customer service god bless k m  ,Positive
 great service  arrived early  looks great  hearts come in gold and silver and in small ziplock bags  overall great for the price  ,Positive
 i may be in the minority on this one  but here s my experience i am trying to go the route of natural or organic products and loved the idea of this one unfortunately  it didn t work well for me it irritated my face so that it turned red  felt itchy  and looked greasy i couldn t wait until night to wash the stuff off  which i m pretty sure is not the intent of any day moisturizer it smells  in my opinion  like old lady perfume   it s too fragrant and is a bit obnoxious the fragrance hung around me all day manufacturer   you have a great idea  but please tweak some of your ingredients   please cut down on the perfume and  if possible  please cut out the inflammatory ingredients   i will then try your product again hope this is helpful  ,Negative
 i have used banana boat products for years   i have always enjoyed the reasonable prices and reliable performance of their sunscreens   so  i was pretty happy to see an aerosol spray version of their product hit my doorstep since i cannot give this product zero stars  i guess i can justify its single star with this   the twisting spray top   instead of having to use a cap to keep the bottle covered  and to avoid accidental discharges of product   you merely twist the top of the bottle when you re done using it to seal it off   a nice touch that said  my experience with this product a couple weekends ago was pretty awful   my two friends and i went out by the pool for a day and all three of us used this spray to protect ourselves from the sun   the day passed and we were fine   no sunburn however  the next morning i looked in the mirror and noticed that my chest and shoulders were all red   huh   no pain  but definitely bright red   i thought it was a painless sunburn or something   the redness faded after two days   my other buddy  however  had a much worse reaction   his skin was bright red and insanely itchy   the itchiness started to fade after a couple days  but the redness took awhile to dissipate   in fact  as of this writing  it s still a little red i will not use this banana boat product again   what the heck did they put into it  ,Negative
 vaseline sheer infusion body  botanical blend lotion hydrates your skin without that oily feeling you get from most other lotions   that is one of the key to a good lotion   the scent is great  and your skin is left soft and smooth   this product is recommended for those who want to keep their skin hydrated and feeling smooth  ,Positive
 this blowdryer was pricey  but worth every penny   i have short to medium length  thin  fine hair  some wavy  some straight    this blowdryer has all the settings i need and actually makes my hair kind of shiny   i have used several other drugstore big box brands and won t be turning back anytime soon   i hate blowdrying my hair everyday  but i have no choice   this blowdryer has not dried out my hair like several other brands have   it s super light  so you don t have to worry if you have ct   the cord is also a wonderful length so i can go anywhere in my bathroom  even when the hubby is trying to get ready too   i highly recommend this  ,Negative
out of all the gelish colors i have purchased this one is by far the most disappointing  it is more of a dull bronze and nothing at all like a vibrant orange like i was looking for  overall a boring color ,Negative
the item arrived on time an in great condition  i have a couple of sun spots on my face and i was hoping that this product would do the trick to lighten them  i have been disappointed with the product because it as done nothing to get rid of the spots or to even lighten them in the least   i used the product for over 4 months without noticing any difference in the appearance of the spots on my face  in fact this product is harsh and there were a few times that my skin felt as if it were on fire and i had to wash it off ,Negative
this does not work at all  i tried to give it to friends and they did not use it either  the plastic flips out and it won t hold thick hair ,Negative
just came today not the same colors as the picture but i guess that s fine i got 4 different green and 2 purple pretty much the same looking colors can t really good tell them apart except the blue white and pink everything else looks pretty much the same but it is glitter dust ,Negative
 i love seche vite dry fast top coat   i use this every time i paint my nails  it s truly a must have for me  i use opi s nail envy as a basecoat  then opi nail polish  and top it off with seche vite dry fast  my nails are completely dry in just a few short minutes   hint  use the top coat while your polish is still slightly wet  it works best this way  after my son was born i did not paint my nails because they never dried before i had to pick him up  change a diaper  etc  so i always smudged my nails just after spending all that time making them pretty  now with seche vite dry fast top coat my nails are dry super fast  my only complaint is that the polish seems to thicken in the bottle fairly quickly  i have only had this bottle for a couple months  and it s already becoming gooey and thick  but it works so well  that i ll just buy another bottle  i highly recommend this for busy moms   ,Positive
 my lashes are pretty flat  and curling them is hassle  with results not lasting very much  that said  this iz by far the worst eyelash curler i have  as of yet  tried  i held the darn thing in place for two minutes  and in less than fifteen second the half of my lashes that did curl  or rather crimp  was flat again  guess it s off to the trash with it  ~$7 down the toilet long story short  this product sucks    would not recommend to anyone    ,Negative
it pretty color but love other color in brand true to color planning to buy other colors dry quickly good price,Positive
 the soap works fine in that it does not dry your skin however i do not like this lavender scent at all   it smells too sweet  almost like honey in my opinion  and the scent is too strong   works in your favor if you actually like the smell  but this is just not for me  ,Negative
 this flat iron works well on fine hair and has an adjustable heat setting   no complaints  just wish it had an automatic off in case you rush out the door and leave the iron plugged in  ,Positive
 this is a great hair dryer   before getting this one  i had always used the cheap conair dryers  figuring that it didn t really matter  i don t think that this dryer has changed my life or anything  but it does dry my hair faster than the other dryers i ve used  and my hair seems much smoother when i use it   i have very fine  naturally wave hair that i flat iron  and i need much less time with the flat iron than i did before  so it s been a real time saver   i have been most impressed by the fact that my hair seems to stay straight longer when i use this dryer   before  my hair would start getting wavy kinky by the end of the day  and i had some crazy morning hair   now  my hair looks pretty straight even after sleeping on it iall night   the only things about it that i don t like about this dryer is that is is a little bit heavy  though i ve gotten used to that   and that the switches are a little bit difficult to operate   they are flat and slide  and don t slide very easily  so you sometimes have to struggle a little bit   overall though  this is a great hair dryer  ,Positive
i love these   the only problem is that the smallest one breaks easily  i didn t care for them we ll i guess ,Negative
 love this stuff   thierry mugler by far makes my favorite winter colognes   i have about 4 bottles of this  4 of pure havane  2 of pure malt  and 1 of every other thierry mugler cologne   this is a great date scent or a scent for the bar   this however needs to be used sparingly  no more than 4 sprays generally limited to 3 unless i m going to a club   also never use this in the summer  way too sweet and strong for hot weather but when it comes to cold weather not much can beat it  ,Positive
 i really like the ibd products because they are good quality  great price  and the bottles are much larger than their more expensive counterparts but after using this basecoat  my daughter and i both discovered that the polish started peeling off after about 5 days   my daughter used it first and i thought she just had   oily nails    but when i finally used it  the same thing happened   the top coat and polish are okay because i d used them many times  it s just the basecoat  ,Positive
 it took awhile for me to write this review because i wanted to give it a fair amount of time to work but it doesnt workprosits not really greasy well it is when you first put it on but then it drys up its a dry oil that means oil isnt running all down you neck and faceits really good for sealing the ends of you hairconsit says its suppose to hydrate your hair and scalp  it hydrates my hair but my scalp is dry or rather yet it makes my hair look hydrated it dosent make your hair softer  ive use this on flat ironed hair and unflat ironed hair and both times my hair was hard or dry feelingmost of motions products really suck for me atleast there s only a couple that are really good and this is not one of them i thought since this was marula oil and everybody was talking about how good it was i figured this would be good to   its not  save your money ,Negative
the bristles are soft but very sturdy   great quality and coverage for face   having fun playing around with the different angles on brushes   very much worth their price ,Positive
always a good choice  this mascara is a bargain for its quality  i have been using it for a while and have no complains at all ,Positive
 i was really excited for this because i use a lot of full nail designs that don t fit my nails the greatest  like the 1st set of bundle monster plates  and i saw a tutorial on how to use this product so i bought it feeling very confident  i was totally let down  like i considered throwing it in the garbage after i tried to use it a few times  i do not know how the person who did the tutorial got her stamp to stay in place  it s a great concept  i love how its soft and conforms to your nails rather than being a hard surface and having to roll it like a konad stamper  but the product itself has a poorly executed design  i know the white surface is supposed to pop out for cleaning but this was horrible  i couldn t get it to stay in no matter how much i pushed it back in it kept popping out when i tried to do my nails  i ended up taking it out and trying to use just the rubber without the holder which was too difficult  and i even tried super gluing it in and it still popped out  it s a major pain to clean it with tape all the time and it picks up tons of fuzzies and what not and the tape pulled it back out all the time  and its really hard to use the images are hard to stamp  i wish i wouldn t have wasted my money on this product  that and i just found one at claire s that is a better value  the stampers come in a kit with 3 plates and a mini special polish for $10 even less if you take advantage of there constant cosmetic   multiples   deals  and there s doesn t pop out like this one does i will still have the fuzzy problem but that s one thing less i have to deal with  if i buy more  like as gifts  or to have one to leave at my boyfriends house  i will stick with the claire s version  ,Negative
 this product gave me skin allergy i started to develop a lot of pimples on my fave so i had to discontinue to use this cream  ,Negative
 in some ways  i love this stuff   it s so easy to apply  covers well  and stays where you put it with no dripping or running   being able to do a whole head application each time without worrying about darkening ends is great  if it only worked   it does just fine covering my gray    no problem at all with this however  the first time i used it  and found the color rather dark   it had faded enough two weeks later to need a new application sooner than usual   even though i ignored this and waited another two weeks  the second time i applied it  and i use the   light chestnut brown   the result was a very  very dark and rather lifeless brown   my hair looks awful   much as i like the application process  i badly need some color oops and will never use this product again    hate the result so much i m throwing out an unused box   ,Positive
 worth every penny an more  in combination with diet  a few other products i use  light therapy and supplements i take i can say it must do something because i was not blessed with youthful or nice skin  quiet the opposite  as a 45 yr old i had suddenly aged 5 years ago  so i did research  tried things and this is one of them that has stuck  i ve used it for 4 years now  a little dab goes a long way  i get about 2+ months out of a bottle  and i use it on my neck as well  it s very light  not to heavy or greasy and doesn t make my acne prone skin break out  this has reduced age spots  darker patches  an fine lines  even helped reduce some heavier ones  skin feels fresh an clean yet when applied  so light i even use the moisturizer over it  but don t need to unless wearing makeup  it s come down alot in price since i first started using it 5 years ago so i stock up  i may just use it everywhere  lol   p s  i started using aminogenesis as one of the first things i did in my regime an added the others  i stopped using this looking for something less expensive  but came back to it  and as luck will have it the price has dropped thank goodness  ,Positive
this has to be one of the best mascara s i ve ever used   i have short stubby eyelashes and really like thick and long my lashes look   it goes on very smoothly if you take the excess off before applying   i am happy to have a mascara that makes my eyes look like i was born with long lashes   i will keep buying l oreal paris voluminous original mascara ,Positive
 i don t know if the other reviewers received a different product than i did or what  but these things do not stick at all  they are really stiff  the top doesn t stick to the finger  even after washing hands to remove lotion  oil  etc    and the bottom doesn t sick to itself  these are useless garbage  i tried everything to make these work with no luck  i finally bit the bullet and bought ez flow nail forms  which i have heard good things about but have yet to try  do not  i repeat do not believe the glowing reviews or buy these  complete and utter rubbish  ,Negative
 fabulous hair product  this oil completely saved my hair and changed my life  my hair was in such a  poor state after years of dying and heat damage and this oil has bought it back to life it s a miracle worker i use it every time i wash my hair  it is quite expensive but for me it is worth it  will defiantly be repurchasing it overall     makes my hair feel more nourished  intensified my hair color  only a small amount of the product is needed     ,Positive
 the smell is overwhelming  i put it on at night and it was horrible smelling it smells exactly like the lipoic acid capsules but alot stronger  that smell did not fade away as i hoped it would and i kept smelling my face   yucky stinky smelling cream  i did not know it contained this and worse than the smell it stung my face as i had been using a retinol product a few times a week  it also was not very moisturising  it kind of made my face feel dry  not moisturised  i usually use neutrogena light night cream and love how moisturising and gentle it is but wanted to switch to a natural product  but i think just plain olive oil is gonna have to do from now on as i cannot use this stuff  i would not advise using it if you alternativley use any type of retinol or glycolic products  or vitamin c type creams  and definitly stay away from this stuff if you have a sun or wind burn as the lipoic acid ingredient will sting your face  ,Negative
 i like to wear this over white   it rally looks cool  but you can also use 2 layers over a unpolished nail for the non crackle look  just add a clear coat and great look  ,Positive
 my husband got this product for me and i wasn t sure about the  shimmer  it was supposed to have   i thought it would be too glittery and come off on cloths and such but it actually was pretty subtle   it has a nice cocoa butter like smell  and lathers well  but i did not find it very moisturizing for a product labeled  deep moisture   ,Negative
 i must preface this by saying that i am very sensitive to products and develop allergies easily  that said  i had a horrible reaction to this product   i m not sure what it was  but after using it once i felt bothered by the powdery smell and developed a headache   i wasn t sure it was the conditioner or not sure i used it again  and after the second use the headache came on strong and very quick  i felt nauseous and my airway began to close   i had to wash it out many times in a row to get the smell out and stop the reaction i gave it to a friend with a caution about my reaction  and she was able to use it just fine so i m sure the vast majority of people will have no problem with this   it did condition well and didn t leave my hair sticky  so it is a solid conditioner    just not one i can be around  ,Negative
 i love this lotion  i love all tingles  the hotter the better  this one did tingle my face a bit but i didn t feel a thing on my body but when i got out i was very dark with a little bit of a pink tone  i already have a dark tan but this took it up a level  the smell is amazing its like a fruity tropical smell and it doesn t have any ato  wish it was way hotter but i knew it wouldn t be  but the color is so great i will alternate with my others  i would recommend this to everyone  also great price ,Positive
 this does not work like this other serum i purchased  noticed no difference or improvement in my face skin  but instead of tossing in the trash  i found out it work good on hands  ,Negative
i ve gone through so many of these  i d be sad if they stopped producing this body wash  i love the scent  it makes my skin nice and smooth and i wash my hair with it too sometimes  great all around body wash  i mainly got it for the orange scent  i love oranges  but it cleans well and feels good too ,Positive
 thich acrylic powder dries lumpy no matter how its done or who does it    & it only comes with enough to do your nails like twice    i recomend buying it from sallys beauty supply  its like four times as much and only twice the price     ,Negative
this wrap has changed the way i deep condition   i enjoy the freedom that this wireless     cap allows me to move around while applying heat to my scalpe   be careful not to overheat the plastic inserts   i think i almost burned my scaple   i had to let it cool down then put it on   awesome     ,Positive
 i ve tried many different eyeliners but i always come back to this one  it is very easy to sharpen  the black is very saturated  i love the attached smudger  and the price is very affordable  ,Positive
 it does a decent job at detangling my children s hair  but it leaves the dry hair so greasy  weighted down and stringy that you have to re wash the hair twice to get it back to normal  ,Negative
 it works great  but 90% alcohol you get from a drug store works just as great   it s so great to be able to do your own nail   i have been doing my own and friends  for the last few months  ,Positive
 i needed to get a new hairdryer and i saw two remington s that caught my attention  i ordered both because i wanted to review and compare the two together since they looked similar but one is almost twice the price of the other  i was intrigued as to what makes one pricier than the other i got theremington ac9096 silk ceramic ionic ac professional hair dryerand theremington d3020 volume and shine hair dryer the remington with the silk ceramic ionic features is priced around $40 and the remington volume and shine dryer is priced around $25  they look similar in the design  shape and color  even the controls are almost the same both dryers have 1875 watts3 heat settings2 speed settingscool shotdiffuser attachmentconcentrator attachment90% more ions for volume and shinethe remington with silk ceramic ionic technology has a couple more features than the remington d3020 volume and shine hair dryer  the dryer with the silk ceramic ionic technology has just that  the ceramic with silk proteins for the purpose of leaving hair smoother and less frizzy  it also has ac motor that is suppose to be a salon professional motor that gives 50% faster styling and 3x longer life of the motor  it does have a 4 year limited warranty whereas the remington volume and shine dryer has a 2 year limited warranty i used both several times to get a feel of the dryer and to which one that i liked personally  i also did a small test myself to determine which one would dry my hair faster and leave it looking better  i towel dried my hair  which is long  thick and coarse  i parted my hair completely in two  pulling apart the two sides  i used a stopwatch and timed myself blow drying my hair dry  i used one dryer on one side and the other dryer on the other side the results both dryers dried my hair in the same amount of time  both sides of my hair looked exactly the same  the pricier dryer didn t dry my hair faster or make it look any fuller or smoother to me  the biggest difference was the feel of the dryers  the remington with silk ceramic technology is a much heavier dryer  the ceramic technology and the heavier motor make the dryer heavier  the remington volume and shine is a very light dryer  i actually prefer the heavier dryer  it just has a nice  comfortable feel in my hand  the lighter volume and shine feels cheap to me  it s just a personal preference because some people may like the feel of the lighter one for me  the performance is the same between the two  ,Positive
 i loved them the first time i tried them  the quality is great and my nails look beautiful  i bought the konad  stamper this is the first time i do my own nails and i am amazed about how easy is to do it  no more salon for me  ,Positive
 to be honest here  if you use their face moisturizer for around the eyes it works great  this eye cream does not do a thing  ,Positive
i don t think that there is a great deal of differece in heated rollers  i ve been using them forever  these are really nice  light  get plenty hot  slide in easily  good clasps  the ion thing may be a real thing    my hair is silky ,Positive
 i have used a variety of blotting papers for a few years now  usually i use the clean n clear  but these were less expensive  you get what you pay for  you need 2 of these  larger  sheets to accomplish what one sheet of the clean n clear  cheap feeling the texture is that of a paper toilet seat cover  this product just isn t very good  sorry  i usually cut the sheet into 2 pieces to make them last longer  i wish i had examined these carefully before cutting  or i would return them my bad  ,Negative
 i m in my early 40 s and have started to get laugh lines  not so funny   and i tried these  they actually feel really hard after applied to y face  and don t hold as well as they should  in the morning  it kind of hurts to pull them off  i went back to my mom s method of using the clear bandaid tape  ,Negative
 my lashes are fairly long  already  but not very noticable   i used this stuff regularly for about two weeks   i did notice a little more length to my lashes  almost right away   it s easy to apply   just swipe across the base of your lashes  like you re applying eye liner   i would apply it nightly  after washing my face  before bed   i stopped using it  though  because it started to make my eyes burn edit i decided to give it another try   i haven t had any trouble with burning since then   i try to use it daily but i m sometimes too tired   it does seem like my lashes are longer but not much more noticable darker   when i wear mascara  however  they look insanely long    i ve been using l oreal double extend mascara   ,Positive
this was very cute i want to give it away to a little girl but i just can t bear to give it up,Negative
again  maybelline is the best  love it that it has a little bit of sparkle   makes my face glow  and looks more fresh like ,Positive
i love this soap   it really makes your skin feel clean in addition to the whitening  great price   just great all over ,Positive
 i had high hopes for this product due to all the great reviews but was only left disappointed  when i used this product  it made my hair come out in big clumps whenever i washed or brushed my hair which never happens  i have very thick  long hair and was very surprised when i saw clumps of it coming out whenever i used this product  once i stopped  so did the hair loss  don t waste your money    ,Negative
 i m on a quest to not wash my hair everyday  so this was a great find for those in between days that you want your hair to smell good  ,Positive
i love it  it puts my makeup on very nice and smooth  i use it for my concelear and foundation ,Positive
looks as described ,Negative
 i have used a lot of   high end   full of ugly chemicals creams and serums and finally decided to check ewg for more natural organic line    after a few misshaps i came acroos sweetsation therapy and now i am absolutely hooked   my skin never looked better after only using these products for under a month   it s simpy amazing   not only they feel good but also great for your skin   everything from this line is amazing    can t wait to order their new organic eye cream      ,Positive
 ugly and is not worth the price  this thing should cost $5 max  i will keep it around and give it to someone as christmas gift ,Negative
 i can t tell if this is a fake or not  as i haven t smelled it at the store  i can say it doesn t smell like peaches and cream to me  or any of the notes listed on some of the perfume web sites  it smells kinda cheap and has that phony burnt popcorn aroma that a lot of cheap perfumes have  it also had no staying power  not that i d want it to    for an edp  i dunno  the box was lovely  bottle was clearly real  and no signs of tampering  could be real  i don t like it  though    ,Negative
 bought a stamp plate set and needed a case to help hold them together   this little wanna be leather case is pretty sturdy and durable so far   held all the plates and you can actually fit 2 plates per but i d be careful with that since you don t want to scratch them up   that s why you re getting the case in the first place  right   overall a good purchase that i would make again if this one ever did fail   but i don t see that happening so this is also a great one time purchase  ,Positive
 these are awkward  but they re supposed to be  they stretch my foot as described  and they are starting to straighten my toes  twisted in an old injury  ,Negative
i couldn t wait to try it out and applied some on my facial skin to see how it felt  it absorbed instantly and my skin felt smooth immediately  there was no bad after effects or stickiness to it at all which i really liked also since i ve been using the day by day hyaluronic acid i ve noticed that my skin feels firmer and even plumper  i really love the results from using this product  with continued use i hope to minimize the appearance of some of my fine lines ,Positive
 first of all the smell is intoxicating  i adore it  it is citrus and refreshing scent  i also like that they product is made from natural ingredients and not harsh chemicals  it is also easy to apply the dropper applicator is brilliant  it quickly absorbs into the skin and is not greasy at oil  you do not feel it at all which i like in a serum i do not like feeling layers of goop on my face because i also apply moisturizer and at times makeup  you do not need to use a lot of product so the bottle will last awhile  my skin looks healthier and the little lines around my eyes are pretty much gone   i am going to to try it on my scar i have on my finger  i know it snot the purpose of the product but i am curious to see if it helps  good value for the quality product very much worth the money  ,Positive
i like jlo but this fragrance is just discusting  i hate it  one of the worst smelling perfumes of the century  i would not spend one cent on this  i collect perfumes and have huge variety  i can tell you this is one of the worst if not the worst i have ever smelled  live smells much better ,Negative
 i was so hopeful about these  i wanted an alternative to tampons that was healthy and environmentally friendly  and cheaper   so i was excited to try them  but it wasn t at all what i was expecting  i don t want to get into vivid details  but basically  i was not warned that this would be such a messy ordeal  not to mention it s not at all convenient  i do not want to leave it in for too long  because if i do  i know it s not absorbing any fluid  so i worry about leakage  or the horrible mess that it will make all over my hands when i try to take it out  gross  also  the thing itself is absolutely huge  i imagine most people would look at it and be terrified to try to put it in their bodies  i believe there was a reason tampons became so much more popular than these methods  sorry  but i ve got to switch back  ,Negative
 i really like the look of the gel polish   it is very easy to do at home and quick  too   durability was ok i have never had a professional gel nail application so i can t compare it to a gel done at a nail salon  ,Positive
 its a good primer   its not at all oily   the bottle is pretty too   it does its job really well   happy with the elf products and my purchase   thank you    ,Positive
 apparently several customers  myself included  have received either fake or expired bb cream from these two sources  i have tried this brand when purchased by a friend  not sure where she got it  and it was a nice bb cream  since the product had mostly good reviews on amazon i decided it would be fine to try purchasing it from here  absolutely wrong   the product itself is good  but it seems very hit or miss on amazon or the missha website  look elsewhere for your korean bb creams  ,Negative
 i used to love this cream it was perfect then they changed it to   get the nsf rating   and it s now terrible it burns my face turns it bright red and burns so bad   now it has sodium benzoate in it  it s so stupid to add sodium benzoate to a product with vitamin c in the name  sodium benzoate plus ascorbic acid  vitamin c  forms benzene  a known carcinogen  it doesn t spread well or even absorb at all anymore it leaves your face clown white right before it turns bright red  im not sure how this has a nfs rating when it seems to have much more chemicals now  it smells less like oranges and more like chemicals and it burns your skin  i can t understand why a company would take a perfect cream  that worked so well and totally 100% ruin it  i makes me mad  why can t they leave well enough alone  not only will i not buy this cream again  i m sworn off of avalon organics 100% until they bring the old formula back  it took me years of trying creams to find one i really loved and stuck with and now i have to start all over again  i don t take this lightly  ,Negative
 there was a time when i would have never considered being without a zeno  but after years of purchasing it  i find that most of what i try to treat just won t go away  and i am following the recommendations on the package directions for what to treat    it just doesn t even work   so that is $15 i will not be spending again  ,Negative
i ve been using this and it works for me to stop places on my face from drying out   this was the second time i ve bought this product ,Positive
 i just dunno  i saw a difference initially  like in the first week  but now  it s been about 3 weeks it s basically the same  no change in my face what so ever  i don t have in realistic expectations  i have freckles and some spots from the sun  i have a few fine lines on my forehead  i m 30 and honestly look 25 or 26  i also use the ageless intensives tone correcting  and i like that better than this  i really don t think it did anything for my skin  at least may not yet anyway  i am looking for a night cream to compliment it  but i don t think this is it  i don t think i ll buy this again at the price that is stated update  after using this for about a month and a half now i can not only see the difference but feel it  my pores are itty bitty  my skin feels great and the color is uniform no red acne scars no weird blotches  just the usual freckles  i think i will keep using this  i will keep buying  ,Negative
 i haven t wore this nail color yet  but i painted one nail and the color is so amazing  its the perfect summer time or spring color  the purple is just a tad bit lighter than the pic idk if its because i used just one coat  but im sure w two you will get the color in the picture  ,Positive
 when i first came across this machine 3 months ago  i thought to myself wow this is a pretty neat concept  let me give it a shot  it was on sale at cvs pharmacy for 6 dollars  so it was a pretty cheap buy  at first i was skeptical about it  because products similar to this usually costs 5 times more  so i got home and set it up  i will write in steps on how to set it up so just incase any of you are having trouble  you can easily follow these steps set up instructions 1  peel the sticker off on top of the soap bottle2  then gently enter the soap bottle into the dispenser and put pressure on it until you hear a click noise 3  pull the red material out from the bottom of the dispenser  this will lead to batteries now powering the machine 4  now place the dispenser wherever you wish  and then slide the button in the back to the right to turn on the machine 5  keep putting your hand next to the sensor  because it is going to take 3 4 tries until the soap starts to come out now that it is activated  your good to go now on to the product review  i am going to be setting it up in 3 categories and give it a overall grade so you can decide if this product is for you functions   i ve had this product for about 3 months now  it hasn t given me any problems  when you put your hand next to the sensor  it releases soap just the right amount  if you had to compare to how much soap is dispensed each time  i would say about the size of a quarter on your palms so it is not a lot  overall this product does what it is advertised to do and i have not gotten any problems or malfunctions body  design & durability    the design of the soap dispenser is pretty simple  it is made of plastic and is shaped so the lysol refills fits perfectly  it isn t very durable and the body is pretty cheaply made  but then again let s not forget this is a 7 dollar soap dispenser  my mom was cleaning the bathroom and dropped this on the floor by mistake  although it still works fine there is a huge crack on the side of the dispenser now  let s take into consideration the fall was probably about 2 feet  so it wasn t a far drop at all  overall  the design is pleasant to look at  but durability isn t that good soap   this dispenser has many different refills you can by that offers different scents  you might be wondering why does it matter  well  these refills are actually very highly scented  when you use the soap to wash your hands  the aroma of the soap stays behind for couple of hours  the refills are very high quality and the smells are very pleasant  some people complain that the refills are very expensive but hey  at the end of the day these refills only cost around 4 dollars at your local drugstores and lasts about 2 months  i cannot speak for others but to me spending 4 dollars on soap every two months is a very good deal overall  this product is a good buy and at your local cvs pharmacy these can go as low as 6 dollars on sale  keep in mind that now lysol is selling the dispensers with free refills  so you can buy both for around 8 dollars at your local drugstores if not on sale  honestly  being realistic for such a cheap price  these things perform great and if you don t abuse the sensor and use the product casually such as 4 5 times a day  these thing can last pretty long  and for the price i would say that it is a great deal additional information  if you feel as if the refills are too expensive  you can always take the top off the empty soap bottle using a screwdiver  takes a bit of effort  and fill it with whatever soap you may want to use let me know if my review helped making your decision easier  and for anyone who might me having glitches or malfunctions with your device  write to me and i will give you some tips on how to fix them  thank you so much for reading my review  ,Positive
 i collect several rose and rose blend perfume  pacifica is a proprietary blend that does smell &#34 rose&#34  enough   my friends would answer rose if i ask them what perfume i m wearing if you put pacifica side by side comparison with pure rose one  you would notice a difference  when it s own no one can tell  so  if you love and use rose perfume a lot like me  very cost efficient therefore the price of this tin can version is very very reasonable  check out at whole foods  it s priced at 7 99  in nyc  when you wear this right after the shower  i do front and back of neck area   first note  it s not like a real layered perfume  though  lasts for a couple of hours   it will faint over the time  but it lasted a slight scent about 8 hours if you want to keep it smell some strength  you may keep adding like every couple of hours like every other reviewers  it is convenient to carry around overall  great buy for the quality and lasting performance fyi  a solid perfume is  in general to last longer than a spray version  ,Positive
i love that there are three sizes for this hair tool  don t settle with a boring ponytail  perfect office hair,Positive
 i started using roc products to help control my acne   it really does help the  retinol that is    you have to be careful when you first start using this product    it can be very drying to your skin and cause redness   i recommend using it every 3rd day for a couple weeks  then every other day  then everyday   i did have some redness at first   but now my skin has no issue   it has taken my acne down from all the time to just a seldom bump   not sure about wrinkles   i m only 28  so i don t have too many yet  ,Negative
 i was a little disappointed when i saw that the ingredients were some kind of fancy  distilled  de atomized water thingy  and rose oil  from what i know  real rose water is just crushed rose petals  so if that is something you need  don t get this i used this to mix some crazy volcanic clay into a face mask so for me  i didn t crush me that this was not true rose water taht was crushed by a unicorn in eden  it smells nice and there s lots of it so that now i can do multiple facials and not worry that it costs an arm and a leg  i d buy it again  ,Negative
 the first thing i noticed about this night moisturizing cream is that it has a nice citrusy smell   the second thing i noticed is that it spreads like elmer s glue but without the tackiness   however  in the morning my face feels incredibly smooth and supple and highly moisturized although i have not yet used this for 8 weeks  the package claims results showed it reduces the appearance of crow s feet and wrinkles around the eye area  i do not doubt it based on the results i have experienced so far   i definitely would have loved this cream only if the feel of spreading it wasn t such a turn off to me  however  i might overlook that and purchase this in the future because the price is reasonable and results are desirable  ,Positive
 i have had the 1 inch curling wand and recently just got the large barrel  i love these curlers  i always got clamp marks from traditional curling irons  but not with these  this iron gets really hot  which i love and i can curl my hair much more quickly than with traditional irons  this gives me great curls that last for days    it does take a little but of learning to figure out which hands to use and how to wrap your hair and it is a little more difficult to fit all of you hair on the small barrel iron if you have really long hair like i do  but i still love these curlers  be patient with it  it s worth it   ,Positive
 older age  less hair  dry skin  and annoying dandruff flakes on dark clothing  ptui  i ve had difficulty finding effective dandruff control in a shampoo that i actually like  this product comes the closest and actually works  recommended for use one to two times per week  i do just that along with dove men+care sensitive scalp fortifying 2 in 1  which has tea tree extract instead of pyrithione zinc  tea tree extract is supposed to work well for dandruff  but alone doesn t do the job for me  pyrithione zinc works nicely but then shouldn t be used every day  so one bottle of each is a good addition to the shower for those with similar experiences in the hair department this shampoo has a medicated shampoo odor  it s not particularly strong or offensive  and is not noticeable at all after the shower  the shampoo foams well and your hair will feel clean afterward  i noticed dandruff decreased within a week and was gone by week 2  nice results  this particular shampoo does not include conditioning agents  though the tea tree containing variety does  i don t notice any problems with the lack of conditioning and don t use any other product after the anti dandruff shampoo so as not to wash away the medication component  no problems there overall  a successful product which does precisely what it says it will do  ,Positive
 used it two times and a huge blind pimple  i never break out   so going back  plus my skin looks shiny ,Positive
 the first day i used this in 70 80+ degree weather with bright sun i came back browner just like i used no sunblock at all  and today the 2nd day of a really bright hot day i m even more darker  really dark  just like i didnt use any sunblock again  and i put on a lot  since it didnt work the first time i used it  and that s just from riding inside a car with tinted back windows most of the day  it s not working at all  plus it goes on so thick and pastey white that i have to wipe my arms off some first and then try and get it off my palms im now looking for non natural sunscreen or atleast a stronger higher spf  50 80+ spf ,Positive
 great color  great texture   but it does feather a bit  try maybelline s 14 hour lipstick underneath to prevent this from happening  or  if you don t have that issue  just enjoy its velvety  moisturizing qualities  ,Positive
 i really wanted a dark red   i specifically did not want a red that was actually purple   and that s exactly what this is   it s like a plum   i don t hate it because this color is in right now  it s just not what i wanted  which was a dark red color  ,Negative
i have purchased irons for about $200 and they were not nearly as great as this one  i love that it has an off on button and that you can control the heat   it s well worth it ,Positive
it looks like hardened vasoline coming from the tube   it smells like perfumed vasoline   it is very thick and greasy ,Negative
this sun block is highly recommended by ewg as safe   it is very thick and does not blend it easily   i found another that is just as effective and safe and goes on smoother because it contains olive oil ,Positive
 suave is one of the cheaper shampoos out there   but hey  they usually smell good and they re good in a pinch   especially considering that a bottle lasts awhile tropical coconut smells good   it s sweet and definitely smells of coconut   i guess the tropical comes from the fact that it is coconut  because i don t sense any other   flavors   in this mix   no pineapple or anything   and it clings to your hair  so hours after taking your shower  you can still smell the coconut   so it is a bit strong the effects on hair are debatable   it does get it clean   but it also dries hair out a little bit and i ve been noticing quite a few more split ends than normal   and since this shampoo lasted me two and a half months  being used on hair that s to the middle of my back  that s a long time to be torturing your hair   but i hate wasting stuff so i stuck it through   i also noticed that my hair wasn t quite as shiny and healthy looking as it used to be  although i cannot definitively blame the shampoo for that    still  it makes me nervous about using it again   it does lather up quite well compare to a lot of natural brands   bubbly and foamy white lather that only takes about a nickel sized drop to generate i m not really sure how this shampoo is considered natural   there s a long list of unpronounceable ingredients and only a few of those are actually natural that i can tell   it just isn t something that should be continually used on your scalp in my opinion   splurge for a little bit better   with ingredients like ammonium laureth sulfate and cocamid mea  i m not really sure that this is shampoo or rocket fuel   i don t know what most of the stuff is the bottom line is that this is cheap shampoo  with a decent scent  but probably not something that should be used on hair that you care about   i recommend avoiding it review by m  reynard 2013 ,Negative
i use this in every shower and it makes my skin clean but does not dry my skin the way average soaps on the market do   we love it and highly recommend it   we all have eczema and have no problem using this soap   soft and gentle and worth the price ,Positive
we used this in the shower for a couple months and didn t notice any benefit with exfoliation or improved skin texture  the soap was really messy so i ended up just tossing it  back to traditional shower gel ,Negative
i really wanted to love this product  unfortunately three days after using it my face is still burning  now i realize that there is supposed to be an amount of burning involved when using a peel or microdermabrasion  however after using this product i don t believe that the granules are safe for my skin  i get the impression that it s not helping me that it s basically giving me micro cuts on my skin i would not use this again and if you have any skin sensitivities at all you should avoid this product ,Negative
 carls daughter  first time using it and it s good  but i don t like the smell  it s not a bad smell but not a good on either ,Positive
 i believe the 12 days of christmas is primarily a catholic holiday  and we aren t catholic i find it is an excellent opportunity to expose the children to the religious meaning of the holiday  this should cover 3 days for one child  though it is supposed to run from christmas till jan 5 i am considering doing it before so they will have a chance to enjoy the early unwrapping and maybe think of the bible verse without all the distractions of the event  and maybe envision something besides santa coming with the giant bag of goodies  ,Positive
 i got this rather quickly after i ordered it and i must say for the price  it s a fabulous product   it is not too greasy and gave me good coverage until i need to color again   i did not notice any rub off on my clothes either so i much appreciate that   i have black hair so the black blended in quite nicely   no one could tell that i used the stick   it s also small like a lipstick so i can take it in my purse whenever i need it   for the price and the gray coverage it provides  you can t go wrong  ,Positive
 this manicure & pedicure set is useful and cute  although i don t use a lot of the tools included  it s still nice to have them included for when i might need them one day  ,Positive
i always bought this from my tanning salon  i love the smell and it moisturizes my skin so soft  aloe is one of my favorite natural ingredients for my skin ,Positive
 i wanted to like this    b c i like jane iredale other products   so  when it first arrived and i tried it out  and it seemed really thick & cakey  i decided to keep it and try again   i have tried many times and every time i have to wash it off my face b c it begins to cake up and look horrible   it does not blend well at all =   i wish i could return it and get my $47 back  ,Negative
 i haven t used all of them  but i use the pink pointy one for applying and blending out my concealer  as well as highlighting and to assist with contouring  overall  you cant go wrong with it  ,Positive
i love love love this product   smells amazing and makes my skin feel even better  i am so glad it came with 3 jars because i will be using this very often  would recommend   ,Positive
 this is a great purple color  it looks a little shimmery in the picture but is not that shimmery on my nails  in bright sunlight  you can see a little shimmer but not much  a nice light purple shade and perfect for spring  ,Positive
 using husbands account  i bought these brushes and i love them  their soft and apply the makeup very well  i m planning on buying another set as a back up  i would recommend these brushes ,Positive
 this own product is definitely non greasy  and is very light compared to other night moisturizing creams i ve used  the cream absorbs readily  and does not take long to massage into facial skin  the rub  i don t think it s as effective as the other creams i ve used in the past  and those fine little lines are creeping back into view since i switched to this product  so  the truth will be in the using over the next month as i use it up  i m hoping i m wrong  because i definitely like the lightweight feeling  and want it to work so i finally have the perfect nighttime product  ,Positive
 smells great  very soothing  but i don t think it s moisturizing enough for me   i used to use water sleeping pack at night and when i wake up in the morning  skin feels and looks great  ,Positive
it was so adorable i was thrilled when it arrived  when i finally took it out of the packaging and went to slip it over my head the chain links snapped and it broke  very disappointed i was very happy with its appearance,Negative
 my daughter uses suave kids care products all the time and they work well she has long curly thick hair and it leaves it fresh smelling  soft and manageable no complaints really love that it s two in one as well  add some leave in conditioner detangler maybe even styling gel all from the suave line and you are good to go  the prices are usually fair as well  ,Positive
 great packaging  very cute and followed theme all the way thru  good eyeshadow colors and very pigmented  having a good time trying all the color combinations  ,Positive
 i ve had this for almost a year now and it still works great  i have yet to buy the diffuser attachment but have often thought it would be a nice addition to my routine  this thing dries my very long thick  curly hair in about 10 minutes  that s 15 less than how long it took my old dryer  i usually just air dry my hair since i don t mind looking like a ragamuffin 90% of the time  but i use this paired with my big round brush  a few drops of paul mitchell super skinny serum  http   www amazon com paul mitchell super skinny serum dp b0012x6mqa  and a hair protecting mist anytime i want to look fabulous for a special occasion     ,Positive
 this product works fairly well  but the smell is awful  it permeates the air and lingers for a long time  breathing it in makes you feel like you can taste it  ,Negative
 i was hoping for a magic acne cure for my adult onset severe cystic acid that i ve been struggling with for over 6 months now  this hasn t cleared up my skin like i had hoped  but it does help a ton to reduce inflammation over night  would definitely recommend  in conjunction with other treatments pros 1  quickly dries out cystic acne over night 2  inexpensive compared to many other products i ve tried  although the bottle doesn t last very long  3  other products seem to work better when there are no inflamed blemishes to deal with cons 1  hard to apply  i use a q tip but inevitably some is wasted due to the watery nature of the product 2  does dry out your skin quite a bit 3  unclear how much it actually &#34 heals&#34  blemishes  while they are reduced in the short term  it does seem like they come back i d also recommend trying out the 20% salicylic acid peel from perfect image and the mario badescu glycolic acid toner  acne hell has basically reduced my skincare routine to slathering my face with various types of acid   but i ve finally started to get traction against it some info about me  age 25  female  i m also taking a hormone blocker called aldactone and i ve cut dairy out of my diet entirely so it s hard to identify exactly which of those things is working   ,Negative
 i had my doubts when reading the descriptions of this product online at amazon and elsewhere  it just seemed that it really wasn t clear what this   hot air   brush would do  increase volume  shine  hmm  ok    should have heeded my instincts read the reviews before ordering so i was aware that given its low wattage this is not meant to be used as a   real   dryer if you have long and or thick hair  so i wasn t expecting this to function as a dryer on my long  collar   medium thick wet hair but i did expect that i could straighten and style damp hair given its description as a   hot air   brush  however  this hot air brush didn t do much of anything for my hair  definitely no volume and no shine  took several minutes  a lot longer than using regular hair dryer and brush   to get small sections of hair straight and dry and though my hair is easily styled set with curling irons  this brush did not add any body or shape  very disappointing about the only thing it is good for  spot drying and straightening damp sections of hair at nape  neckline  etc  after a shower or bath before then going on to actually style hair with electric rollers and or curling iron  at this price  that s an expensive product option since one could easily do the same with any cheap hair dryer and a brush my hair is wavy rather than tight curly but i found that this brush was not very effective in straightening hair or adding   body   though i tried it on hair that was different degrees of damp   and yes  i followed the instructions  which suggest that you use when your hair is   80% dry   and i did turn my hair upside down and blow brush out from the roots  as for making my hair less static  could not discern any noticeable difference only seeming plus  it did not seem to dry hair out as much as when using a traditional hair dryer and brush having used it quite a bit in initial two weeks i did not feel comfortable returning it  but i wish i had  total waste of money given some of the other newer comments  it seems that no matter what length your hair is  others have experienced similar problems and disappointment to the folks at john frieda hair care products  i hope you read these comments and do something to improve the product  i love your actual hair care products and use them daily so my expectation level for the performance of this product was high based on prior positive experience  ,Negative
 i have color treated  slightly damaged hair  the biggest issue i have is the ends of my hair  while i have no split ends  the ends appear damaged and lighter than the rest of my hair if i let it dry naturally  which i prefer to do  i went to a salon to get my hair styled and the stylist recommended this shampoo  even though they didn t sell it there    she swore it was a holy grail product after using this shampoo once my hair felt a bit thicker at the ends and smoother  after using it a few times my hair look infinitely better when i let it dry natural  to the point that people were complimenting it  it also feels much healthier  the first time i ve been truly happy with my hair was once i introduced this joico color therapy into my life  i love this stuff  love  i recently messed up and purchased the regular joico k pak reconstruct shampoo & conditioner and it is not as good  it works well  but i will be going back to this as soon as it runs out  highly suggest you get the color therapy if your hair is damaged  even if you don t color it  ,Positive
 this gel is not the same as the other self tanning lotion i have used in the past   it does not dry in five minutes  i see no color change  and the odor remains for hours  even after i tried to wash it off   do not waste your money  ,Negative
i ve purchase the smaller 1oz version before which was better than the 2oz version  the 2oz version turned an ugly urine color and the consistency was more like water and had an awful smell than the 1oz version which had a thicker consistency  i believe i had a bad batch  don t trust that more is better ,Negative
 i started using this product and within a couple applications noticed that a lot of hair was coming out when i pic d or brushed my hair   i stopped using this product and it went back to the normal amount of stray strands   the smell is also unpleasant   i have used several other products in the l oreal ever line and always found their scents pleasant   this one smells like extra hold hairspray with some undertones of a natural scent i couldn t discern   if it would have helped my fine hair have more volume i probably could have dealt with the scent  but causing my hair to come out when brushing landed this product in the trash  ,Positive
i love this product  especially the brushes that come with it  there so great  i also love the box  the makeup is great quality ,Positive
 there was basically 4 size points and the rest were completely the same sizes  but i guess it s fine considering the price of it ,Negative
 two words to describe this   warm and sweet   it has some flower notes in there though that counteract with the sweetness    they are very very slight and definitely in the background of the white chocolate vanilla sugar  honestly perfumes don t usually have this power over me but this scent is almost mouth watering  but without being foodie or syrupy  i still remember the first time i smelled this  when it came out  around 2005 when i was 13  i instantly loved it then and still love it now at 22  i smelled it only once in 2005 and just smelled it again today when i bought it  i ve remembered the scent for like 8 years      it s that unique   clearly it s very recognizable    it s not immature though  very different than scents like mariah carey s junk and pink sugar  pink sugar is what i would consider immature  it s a very memorable fragrance    and has such a huge silage  the dry down reminds me a little bit of burberry brit  i smelled this on a girl the other day and thought she was wearing brit but she told me it was fantasy  ,Positive
 oh well  my hair is very  very fine and in my advanced years getting thinner all the time  so i guess volume is a pipe dream for me  as for the conditioning part  i thought it worked quite well for me  pour some on your hand and work it into your hair and rinse  that s a no brainer   i love the dispenser and how easy it is to pick up  pour and close back up without any mess  and for that i ll add on the extra star i was going to take away for no volume  there is a slight scent to the conditioner  but not overpowering  all in all a nice product  but a wee bit on the expensive side for my frugal household  ,Positive
this shampoo has a great scent and does a great job on my daughter s medium thickness hair   i tried it with my fine hair and i was a frizz ball   her hair looks beautiful and smells great though ,Positive
i bought this pack because it said that alot of lipsticks came and of the 10 thats came maybe only 4 where good the other one where bad and smelled horrible not very pleased with this product,Negative
 smells really nice  and it works great on bug problems  i use it in baths and with lotions  it makes my skin feel smoother too  ,Positive
 after reading a few reviews on here  i decided to buy this at cvs   i am glad i did  mine does not look like this photo here   mine does not have a stuck on label  as shown in this photo  i am totally assuming this is not the real deal and i wish amazon would not sell it  ,Negative
 love this unit  will be purchasing again  i just wish there were more colors  this would look fab in an ombr&eacute   it s not &#34 whole lace&#34  but it has a nice wide patch of lace that gives a lot of room and versatility for parting along with baby hairs and an extended neck which makes for a nice ponytail or updo  looks really natural ,Positive
 my teen loves the fresh herbal scent with hint of orange  and stresses that it smells good enough for male or female use  put pea size dab on hand rub together and apply on damp hair  and style  you can style any way you want and it alwasy comes out right  ,Positive
the effects are of course temporary but these 2 lotions do smooth slight areas of cellulite  i havent figured out how to use this along with self tanner though to be fully summer ready ,Positive
 i bought this cleanser just based off the reviews here on amazon  i wear primer and makeup every day  so i normally use st  ives apricot scrub  or the walmart generic  because it s the only thing that makes me feel &#34 clean&#34   well  i keep reading about how using scrubs every day is not the best for oily acne prone skin  i had tried a cetaphil cleanser and was not impressed  felt like it didn t take all my makeup off  cerave is amazing though  i just need to use a small amount and it really cleans without being harsh on my face  it also doesn t leave my face feeling greasy  but at the same doesn t dry it out  i highly recommend this for all skin types  ,Positive
 really good moisturizer   just a little bit of retinol in it   doesn t cause me to breakout   makes skin softer  clearer   do not use if pregnant  ,Positive
the covergirl & olay simply ageless concealer offers smooth and even undereye coverage while hiding fine lines  this is my second time purchasing this product  this first time i bought it i was looking for something to new to replace a mediocre product i was using  this product is definitely a keeper  it is quite a value considering it can last 6 months or longer  it really goes a long way ,Positive
 i have very sparse brows plus a rather sizeable scar that goes across my left brow and temple  so hair doesn t grow there   i have been using benefit shelaq for years to seal brow color  that product leaves brows shiny   it s also been discontinued by benefit   i am delighted to have tried model in a bottle   it works so much better than shelaq and it s a fraction of the price   no more stiff shiny brows here    i cannot tell you how happy i am to have tried this   it s going to become a staple from now on  i love that it doesn t leave a shiny brow trail  nor does it alter the color of the brow product like shelaq did  plus  my brows aren t stiff   this is about as natural as you ll get to having natural lush brows  i absolutely recommend  without hesitation   ,Positive
hello everyone if you are into nail art like me and want a sturdy and grade a quality product well these nails are it  omg these are the best nail tips money can buy  now lets be clear don t get theses nail tips and then leave a negative review for them   people when you are doing acrylic nails at home or a salon remember this the tip only adds length not strength too the nail  please make sure your bead consistency is right not too dry and not too wet and research on how to apply acrylic too the nails you do not apply it like nail polish  there are three zones the nail its the tip then the stress point also called smile line then the top get some practice wheels from amazon and practice making the proper bead consistency first and how too use acrylic nail brush  my friends if you learn these steps you will be amazed at your skill level in doing your own nails,Negative
 love this  gel eyeliners are so easy to use even for beginers  love this product  my only concern is the pencil  it s a good pencil but i think i m gonna use an old pencil apliyer i have to make my life easier  other than that i really really love this  stays put all day and it does not crease i repeate it does not crease  even survives to sweaty days and warm weather  ,Positive
this product dries my hair out   it also makes my hair feel more brittle   i was using this on my receding hairline to reduce harsh chemical exposure to my already thinning hair   but this product did not work   i stopped using after one bottle,Negative
i found that this shampoo did what its manufacturers claimed  i felt that my hair was cleaned and not greasy  i used only about a teaspoon of the shampoo and it was enough  i had so many suds that i also used it to wash my face  the shampoo had a slight sweet manly smell with just a bit of a menthol odor  its conditioner did more to making my hair feel light than other shampoos ,Negative
lots of fake reviews here       don t let them fool you,Negative
 i liked this so much    it s quick  not too heavy  good choice of settings  very quiet  so i ve already purchased two more as gifts ,Positive
does not last long and not as good as store bought thickening mascaras  not remotely justified in its cost of effectiveness ,Positive
 i read about this product and found it on amazon  my nails have never been great and i have neither the interest nor the patience to fuss with them  but they ve been so bad in the last couple of years due to peeling  breaking and  worst of all  ridges and splitting down into the quick  this product was recommended for disguising the ridges and helping the nails to appear smooth again  i first tried it by using two coats and then finishing with colored polish  wow   so smooth that it looked like i had false nails  but the polish began to come off after a couple days  i didn t have the time or patience to apply more than one coat of polish   so i removed the polish with acetone remover  expecting to also remove the essie base coat  i thought i was done  but there was still a thin layer of the essie that made my nails look much better than normal  after a few days i tried putting on two coats of polish first  then finishing with the essie as a top coat  that held up well and still looked good  but i guess i m just not a colored nail person because i wasn t enjoying the look  however  i noticed that my nails were growing out better than they ever have and i was not dealing with the problems mentioned above  so i removed the polish completely and tried using just two layers of the essie  it isn t quite clear   has a slight peachy color  but is close enough to a natural look that i m very happy with it  the difference in my nails is nothing short of amazing  i ve had no ragged edges or splits  my nails look thick and healthy  and they are so long that soon i will have to cut them with a clipper  this product seemed expensive when i decided to try it  but it s worth it to me   i also recently switched to using a glass nail file  also found here on amazon  and that seems to be helping my nails  too   ,Positive
 the positive reviews must have been generated by angellift owners and employees  because this product does absolutely nothing but deplete your bank account   notice they use the word   angel   to create feelings of trust in their product  clever  i ve been using the strips exactly as directed for five months now   with no improvement whatsoever    i even took before and after photos    i m so mad at myself for falling for this rip off product  but i m furious with this manufacturer for capitalizing on women s desires to reduce wrinkles and look younger   keep your hard earned money  girls  better yet  take that money and start saving for something that really works  ,Negative
i have thin long hair and thought this could assist in making a bun however to my disappointment it pokes out and doesnt stay when i bend it at the end   i bought 2 and regret it,Negative
 i love this comb it detangles my natural hair with out the pain  i am tender headed  so for me this comb means no more painful comb outs that leave my head sore  it s very durable and strong i really love how well it works  ,Positive
this perfume smells soooooo good  so fresh and it really last all day  everyone always compliments me about it and always know what im wearing  i would give it a try if i were you ,Positive
i have dry skin and my face had alot of acne cause other than being in the sun alot and with work and sweat nothing wasn t working on my face  the smell is very delish and it has a very light texture to it  just a little dab with my finger and massage it into my face  within days i can see my face clearing up the touch of it to my skin feels like moisture bursting without that oily feel which i love  if you have facial skin problem this is one of the best i ever used ,Positive
 recently  my dermatologist advised me to wear an spf 30 sunscreen daily  spf 15 once in a while doesn t cut it  i was delighted to discover this product for any number of reasons  first  it goes on smoothly  absorbs quickly and  most importantly  doesn t leave a greasy residue  second  it s price right  plenty of competitive brands cost twice as much or more  third  it can withstand the exertion of active sports  although i reapplied it  but that wasn t hard  because i wasn t a grease ball   last  the smell  well  there is no discernible fragrance  to me this is banana boat sport coolzone sunscreen lotion s best feature  i cannot stand smelling like a smoothie  especially when i am not on a tropical island i encourage you to try this product  ,Positive
 well made  paid $2 and can t go wrong here  if you are looking for cheap lashes  these are them  you do need to trim them to fit your eye though as they are a bit long  ,Negative
 i used to think stamping polishes were unnecessary  and that i could stamp with any polish  but these konad polishes have changed my life  they re opaque in one stamp and they transfer to the stamper perfectly  when i use regular polish to stamp  i have to scrape with very little pressure or all the polish comes out of the image  but with these polishes  i have to scrape with more force because the polish stays better in the image it sounds like a lot of money to pay for a polish you only use for stamping  but if you re looking to take your designs to the next level  i highly recommend using these polishes also  i thought i would only get tiny bottles with not a lot in them but this 11 ml size is only slightly smaller than an essie bottle  for reference  ,Negative
i have fine hair that is quite long and this really works   it gives me volume and waves that are wonderful   i have gotten so many complements that i think i should buy stock in this company ,Positive
 i m not too hot on this glue  i will admit that i only just began wearing imitation lashes  not plastic  but real human hair on a strip   the glue kind of worked  for about a day  but then it wouldn t hold as well in the inner lid area so the lash would bend upwards  i just took them off after one day because i was so annoyed that they wouldn t stay glued down  i used ardell lashes too  if this helps   the glue is very black and unless you apply perfectly  then it looks like you have smeared eye liner  i used a qtip to apply it to the back of the strip wish it would have came with an applicator like revelon lash glue  ,Negative
 overall  i like this hair dryer   it is powerful  and i dried my short hairstyle in less than 2 minutes using the low setting   i cannot notice that my hair is any shinier than usual  but it definitely has more volume   the blue cold shot button works much better than the one on my previous hair dryer the metallic apple green color is much nicer than it appears in the picture here on amazon   the cord is sufficiently long  and heavy duty   there is also a nice travel case included  as well as a concentrator i do have some complaints though   i took off the removable lint filter  and put it back on   now i cannot remove it at all   i read in another review that someone else had the same problem with not being able to remove the filter cover   my husband has stronger hands than me  so i am going to let him try to take it off for me the dryer is heavier than what i am used to   that would not be a problem  but the weight is not balanced very well  and the unit is top heavy   it is a bit awkward to use because of that  but i think that i will become accustomed to it after a couple more days   a little bit more weight in the handle would have solved this problem   for the average home user for uses a hair dryer for a few minutes daily  i think it is fine even though this dryer comes with a travel case and has a twist folding handle  i would not consider it a travel dryer in any way   as i mentioned before  it is fairly heavy and it does not fold up compactly   the twist folding handle is convenient for storing it in a bathroom drawer however  ,Positive
 i ve become a fan of the suave professionals products  i adore the moroccan infusion line  and this fits in well with the suave brand   the scent is fairly light and pleasant  somewhat spicy  somewhat floral   the shampoo is a bit thicker than the conditioner and lathers nicely   it s pleasant to use and gets my hair clean i recommend using this shampoo with the coordinating conditioner  ,Positive
 this was recommended by my chiropractor since i have trouble falling asleep at night  i think the original intention is for regularity  but it does seem to work well in  calming  my system at bedtime  i take 2 tsp about 30 before bed  the cherry flavor is a little sour but nothing to make me stop using it  i have not tried any other flavors but might try the orange next time just for a change  ,Positive
i notice nothing from using this all week  i am considering returning it  i cant afford to waste money   tjmaxx has a bunch of this brand i believe   never moves off shelf ,Negative
 like most reviewers  i agree that the toner itself is great i mostly just wanted to talk about the bottle design  i was really afraid to buy this because so many reviewers said the opening made the product hard to use but nobody wrote about how the opening actually looked  once you screw the cap off  it basically just looks like the opening of a water soda bottle  maybe other people were looking for more of a small opening that you have to shake squeeze the bottle to get product onto the cotton however  this was exactly what i was looking for  it makes it so easy to just hold a cotton pad  i use cotton pads  not balls  at the opening and quickly flip down and back up once or twice  so hopefully  this helps for anyone who was concerned about what the opening actually looked like  ,Positive
so i bought this product hoping to get my eyelashes growing as i have naturally short lashes and i don t have a lot of volume either  so let me tell  if you don t have it it is not gonna grow from nowhere   i didn t have any irritation or darkening of the skin or anything  it has been 4 weeks and nothing had changed looks like i am religiously putting this thing on me and absolutely nothing happens i think it will help you grow your lashes back if they had been damaged but not if you didn t have any lashes and magically they gonna appear  so yeah  not working ,Negative
takes for ever and im still waiting for this   never again   takes to much to get it   wowi will get it to an actually store ,Positive
i have a whole beautyrest regimen and i try to keep my skin looking as young as possible my mother was able to do it and now that i m almost 30 my skin looks about 20and this just adds to the beauty thank you,Positive
 i wear ponytails all the time and have a wide variety  with this one  the quality just isn t there  there was only one comb and it was sewn on the side instead of the top  there was a lot of breakage of the hair at the top of the pony  which made it really obvious it was fake  ,Negative
 i really like the pantene products for colored hair   i always buy the brunette  i have conditioner also   i find that using the shampoo  and conditioners  really make my hair color last   i like to stretch it out as long as possible just to save on my hair   i highly recommend any of these products in whatever haircolor you are trying to preserve  ,Positive
 i picked this up because i have naturally frizzy hair    not curly enough to leave natural  but very difficult to straighten  i wanted something to use after straightening to add some curl back in  crazy  i know   i got carried away the first time i used it and ended up looking like shirley temple  not a good look for a 46 year old if you want waves and not real curls  keep it on the lower setting  heats up very fast  a bit awkward to use at first  but once you get the hang of it  easy  ,Positive
 i purchased this item and requested a reimbursement since for all i can see  it s only a sun screen   reading the small print it seems to do nothing else than protect your skin from getting wrinkles and dryness from exposure to the sun   that is definitely not what i am looking for on a product claiming to have retinol  which is the over the counter version of retin a which does correct wrinkles  appearance  not the wrinkles themselves  but somehow makes them less noticeable   please ladies  and gents  keep in mind that we must be realistic   the wrinkles you have already will never go away  you can protect your skin from getting worse ones and make it look plump and luminous and even lighten some of the sun exposure damage or other dark spots   however  this product will never do it   however  the roc discs are excellent and within a week of using them  i noticed a great improvement in my face  neck and d&eacute colletage  and very  very soft  use a good moisturizer after it and you re done  ,Positive
 this stuff is great  you only need to use it a couple times a week so even if you forget the oil youll be okay  it works better with oil though  ,Positive
 such awesome moisture spray  spray a few times after washing face  dont even need a moisturizer of lotion  this keeps my face very soft and quenched  ,Positive
i can see how maybe this product works for a person with very very deep wrinkles    using this every night may lift some of the indentations  i have very minor forehead wrinkles and this product does absolutely nothing for me  i would suggest not wasting your money ,Negative
 i bought this wig once and i liked it until on the 3rd day of me wearing it the straps both fell off  i thought it would be ok  so it wont be as snug as i want it     that night went to take it off and the front and back fell apart     i messaged them and told them they offered me a refund or to ship out another one    so i opted for another one  november 20 it was shipped  here it is dec 21st and still no wig    don t do it  go somewhere else to get your product if you want to receive you product and a quality product  i did receive a refund  that s the only thing good that came out of this  ,Negative
 i have always struggled with dark under eye circles  i have spent my life searching for the perfect concealer  this is it  it doesn t cake up under my eyes  it goes on smoothly  and best of all  it covers my dark circles     already bought a second one    ,Positive
 i did not like  the wig is very big  i do air balloons in the head  the haircut is different  longer  is a different color  different from the photo in the end they sent me another wig not they asked  no like     ,Negative
 i ve just received my second order of this lotion and expect it will become a standard   good texture and feel  subtle and rapidly disappearing scent  quick absorption   i thought i had earlier rated this 4 stars but  if so  i am boosting my rating now   one minor drawback is the relatively quick fading of the moisturing effect  which could be related  in part  to living in new hampshire in mid winter   the ingredient list is reassuring  unlike a vast number of other lotions on the market  ,Positive
love this case and brush set  i m not sure what some of them are for   but i m sure i will figure it out  i do love that tthe bristles don t fall out and stick to my face like the other brush set i have ,Positive
 this wig is very cute  lightweight and comfortable that being said   it does not look anything like the picture   it is chin length  not pixie cut like the picture shows  also  it is definitely not what i would consider brown  it s more of a light caramel color  gold in the sun  and very fake shiny  it is not capless like the description says  it has a wefted cap  just like regular full wigs  then again  what would you expect for so cheap  as a person with medical hair loss  it is definitely not an every day wig the two stars i gave it are for being exactly what i bought it to be  a cheap wig  easy to just throw on for those days that i don t feel like messing with my good wig  good enough for me  ,Positive
 i like the fact that you dampen the sponge before using it to apply liquid foundation  because that helps with the smooth application results   this sponge is made of good quality sponge material that i dont anticipate cracking or breaking apart like cheaper sponges tend to   it doesn t work miracles  of course  but i am pleased with the sponge and it works a bit better than my fingers  which work better than any previous sponge    read the directions for use and care  ,Positive
 i found these and was super excited about the price  but when i looked at my orders and it said  shipped   i contacted the seller and they told me that they had a &#34 server malfunction&#34 i never got a replacement or my money back   my opinion  i m pretty sure that it s a scam  if something s too good to be true  it probably is i am pretty bummed that i never actually got these because they look extremely cool  and i hope that if anyone chooses to buy these that they will have a better experience than i did  ,Negative
 i was looking for a while for a nail polish shelf rack  and found this one  love that i didnt have to find a place for it  you just hang it on the wall  dont know how many nail polish it fits but i just love this rack  arrived early  nicely packed  new  no scraches  ,Positive
 i have been using a nail strengthener which works wonders for my nails but seriously dries out my cuticles  anyways  i purchased this stuff when i ran out of my cuticle cream and it s pretty terrible  it s more of a watery consistency than an oil and isn t very moisturizing  i wouldn t buy it again or recommend it unfortunately    ,Negative
 if you ever gleamed anything from frugal relatives  it s that you can put two tennis balls into the dryer to dry the clothes faster   i ve even heard martha stewart say to do it   these  dryer balls  are just a way to bank on that old home remedy   plus  tennis balls are very cheap and will likely last much longer  ,Negative
 i love the burts bees line  but i really dont like the way my skin looks when using this product especially in the morning  maybe i have a small reaction to it but i dont think so  it is a lill greasy and smells funky i could handle that  but i dont see that it does any good for me  if anything making my skin look bad  ive been using it on my hands until its gone but i wont be buying it again  ,Positive
i luv deva curl products  it makes my hair more manageable and it smells good as well   it does take longer to use when cleansing your hair but it is worth it in the end ,Positive
 i ve tried my fair share of tanning lotions out there and try to give anything new a shot   i ve been tanning for 7+ years now and love bronzers   this time for budget purposes  i wanted to find a tanning lotion that was $20 or less and chose to try this one   it seemed pretty popular   as far as the scent  it s relatively mild compared to most   you don t get that burnt skin mixed with tanning lotion smell with this one that you do from a lot of other tanning lotions   as far as color  however  i m not impressed what so ever   i ve tanned quite a few times using this lotion already   and to be honest  not seeing nearly the amount of color i should be seeing   if you re looking for a tanning lotion that gives you good color  i d probably look elsewhere   designer skin makes some really good ones that are relatively inexpensive as well   don t buy into the name of this product and waste your money  ,Negative
 did not bond well with the silk nails   would never purchase this item again  not as it was advertised  ,Negative
 this curls your hair very nicely   and overall works really well  yes like others have said  it is a bit more slippery than other wands but with practice you get used to it  the barrel is tapered  so you do need to hold it at certain angles to ensure it doesn t slip off  i really like this wand because i can curl my hair and my curls will stay intact for 2 to 3 days without any hair spray or anything  if you want larger wavy hair i recommend getting this one  if you want tighter smaller ringlets get the smaller one  ,Positive
 i got this to use in my son s hair     for years he s had a problem with dandruff  and no matter what we used  nothing gave us any relief   when i saw this product  i thought i d try it   he s been using it for about a month now   last week i took him to the barbershop for a haircut  and even the barber commented on the fact that his dandruff problem seemed to be resolving   i believe his exact words were   are you using something different in your hair   because you have hardly any dandruff     add to that the fresh  clean smell    and this is a product worth trying  for those who struggle with dandruff   certainly everyone is different  but this product worked for us  dyb ,Positive
 i have used this one and the shiseido  i loved the shiseido  but i believe i love this one a little more  feels less greasy  not sure if it makes sense  but it does the job of removing makeup  do it     ,Positive
 i love the lip balm  it s softy shiny  feels great and really moisturizes  however  all the stars in the world don t make up for the poor packaging  mine arrived cracked  in several places  and actually had been deep enough that some of the products  oil  leaked thru them leaving the outside of the container greasy feeling and the inside of the box with oily spots i love how it looks  love how it feels  but for the high  premium price i expect the packaging to reflect the contents as well  it was damaged and so back it went  seeing as i m not the only one with this particular problem i won t be repurchasing  ,Positive
 i ve bought several colors from this same brand and i ve been happy with them  but this one  totally different story  this one clumps up  and yes  i do know how to cure my nails and have the necessary tools  the other colors  same brand  don t clump like this one  ,Positive
i like it because it has a brush holder compartment that holds normal size brushes  it comes with a little mirror  it s medium size and a lot fits in there  it s not big  it wont fit my lorac pro palette buy an inch  but i like it a lot ,Positive
i ordered these over two months ago and they still have not shown up      i contacted the seller and they said that shipping can be tricky sometimes and to continue waiting and be patient    2 months is pretty freaking patient if you ask me   i know they are cheap and it seems like a good idea but dont do it   it is not worth the aggravation ,Negative
the magic marker tip became coated with the sunscreen i apply and stopped working so i threw it away and went back to my pencil ,Negative
 rinses out very easily yet very thick and rich in consistency  not too perfumy  a clean neutral smell  not toofemmy  ,Positive
 i can t wait to use these  they came 2 days early  so i am sooo excited to put them on  they are full cover tips in clear as described  so i don t know why the other reviewers had an issue  but i got lucky and got just what i wanted     ,Negative
expected delivery date was no sooner than july 25th   i got the lashes on 7 15  boxes got a little crushed but all the lashes were in tact and usable ,Negative
 i use this cream for about 3 weeks now  every morning and before i go to bed  and my skin around my eyes got visibly finer and the fine crow feet that i already had  are less visible as well  the cream is not oily at all  leaves a nice and smooth feeling on the sensitive skin around my eyes  and doesn t smell bad like so many others i tried before  i am normally a neutrogena fan  and i love their products as well  but the roc retinol correxion eye cream is definitely the best eye cream i have tried so far  i am 38 and the skin around my eyes is usually ok  but when i don t get enough sleep or when i am stressed with work  my crow feet come out more and i also tend to have dark circles around my eyes  this cream achieved to diminish the crow feet and in general softened my skin a lot  i am very happy with it  ,Positive
 this shipped and two days  and was perfect  exactly what i needed  the clips held my hair tight  though they are a little large  the brushes work fantastically  and it s very easy clean up  great product  ,Positive
 this is basically honey in a jar  that s the best way i can describe it  i put this on freshly washed hair  and then sat under the hood dryer  the next morning  my hair still wasn t dry  it left my hair a sticky mess  so i had to wash it out immediately  i am so happy i tried this product on a weekend rather than a day i had to go to work  because then i would have been sol people say that you should only put a tiny bit your hair  or that you should mix it with the smoothie  or the hair milk  but that s too troublesome to me  i want a product that i can just put on my hair and go  without worrying if i put too much or to little  or that i have to mix it with something else to work  especially with the price  i have cheaper products that moisturize and style my hair on their own  i don t want to be a hair chemist to make my hair look nice  i want something that is quick and easy  and this is not it  this was just a huge pain for me on the bright side  it s smell really nice as all shea moisture products do  ,Positive
 i have nails that bend like paper   this nail hardener really works well   my nails are rigid now and can take shellac nail polish that stays on for 3 weeks  it s too bad my nails grow so fast or it would last longer  before this nail hardener  the shellac would crack off in two days   be careful to put it on thin or it causes pain  test it on one nail first   i just hope this product is safe since it is absorbed into the nail bed as well  ,Positive
 my experience with this product is that it contains so much menthol  even tho  it s listed at the end of the many ingredients  that the scent of it stings my eyes  it feels like putting vicks on my face  i cannot imagine how this is an appropriate product for the face   i guess i ll try to use it for other parts of the body  but since it s so creamy  i notice it makes my feet slippery in the shower if i use it on my feet  ,Negative
i tried this based on the reviews and i am glad i took the chance  i mixed it with water when using since i wasn t comfortable with putting the direct acid on my face  considering that water is acidic also   lol   i like it and it worked  my face did seem to have a bit  more moisture and didn t feel dry as much as it did before  i don t use it everyday but i do use it at least three times per week ,Negative
 i ordered this from proactiv not this vendor  i think the price on here is too high though   anyway  i have black heads on my nose and chin   i ve use biore strips and those didn t work and neither did other drug store brands   i used this with a panasonic black head clearing tool  it sucks out the puss and i bought on amazon i recommend that tool also    i noticed a dramatic difference in my pores and my black heads really started to diminish   i didn t realize how great it was until i ran out and i can see the black heads coming back and pores getting larger   i recommend getting it from a proactiv kiosk in the mall or calling them because this price is too high  it s a good product  ,Negative
 i can t believe this company has the nerve to set a price of $38   amazon had it for $10 59 and i got it with some other alleged plumpers of about the same price to try it out   the current price is $21    just ridiculous   it is a pretty lip gloss with a slightly sweet taste   it licks off easily so it doesn t last long   it has no other effect  but the company includes a long information page in many languages with purportedly scientific details and the fact that you ll get best results when it s used in combination with several of their other products   incredible   i don t give it one star because i save that for products that actually cause harm or are extraordinarily displeasing  ,Negative
i like cheap and for $1 that s good for me but i d honestly rather spend a little money and get a good brush  this is horrible  it doesn t spread foundation more like mops it around  the brush gets wet and tacky  the foundation looks caked on when applied with this brush seems like it just absorbs the liquid and doesn t spread i ve seen nothing but good reviews for e l f but i m not getting the hype ,Negative
this nail primer didn t do its job  the formula seems to be different because this once was some good stuff  however my nail began to lift around the edges and it was not a pretty sight  also this is lifting that i experienced immediately not due to needing a fill in ,Negative
they were plastic and completely cheap  didn t wanna stick even with the expensive glue  the lash line was too thick   the ones on thread are much better   ,Negative
 it seems like it should work like the original  but it is so thin and cheaply made  that the loop ripped after the first use  ,Negative
this facial wash reminds me of cetaphil   you rub it on a dry face and then wet to rinse off   i like it overall and feel that it does a good job cleaning my skin   my skin feels smooth and clean after using   it does not feel dry even though this is a wash for normal to oily skin   i like the ingredients as well ,Positive
 i purchased these to replace the ones that came with the sander   i haven t used these yet  but i like the fine for my nails  ,Positive
 i ve had to downgrade my skincare and makeup routine   and by downgrade  i mean shop almost exclusively at the drugstore  i ve managed to find wonderful drugstore alternatives to department store makeup and haircare  but skincare has been tough  i m at the point now that  despite being able to afford more expensive items  i m happily sticking with my bargain finds  why spend more if you don t have to  right  i m more interested in how i look and feel after application  versus caring so much which brand or fancy packaging i hold in my hand skincare was trickier  i ve tried a host of brands over the last few years  from olay to aveeno to about every other option available at drugstore prices  i ve had negative reactions to a few  especially olay  which caused me to break out and took my normally dry skin to oil slick territory  others may not have caused me any discomfort or spots  but i was simply unimpressed with the texture and appearance of my skin i gave this product a try because  honestly  i just did not want to spend $80 on my daily nightly routine this time around  plus  neutrogena was one of the few drugstore options i hadn t attempted so far  over a week in  i am happy with this product  i spent under $40 for the day and night version of this  which is a true bargain for something so potent  it has a scent  gardenia  maybe  or lily    but it doesn t bother me at all  it feels very light and sinks in quickly  i have ridiculously dry skin  the kind that develops peeling  scaly bits if left unattended  despite only using the recommended pea sized amount  i ve had no dry skin issues whatsoever  my last face cream resembled pudding  and it still didn t properly hydrate me unless i slathered it on my face i am in my mid 30 s  shun the sun  and live a  fairly  healthy lifestyle  so i do not have many advanced signs of aging  past the typical age related areas  crinkling around the eyes  slight creases around the mouth  and the like   so  i cannot attest to how well these potions work on intense signs of aging  my main problems are with uneven skin texture  uneven coloring  and dullness  these lotions have done what creams twice and three times their cost have done  minimized these issues and made them more manageable i adore the packaging  it s simple  slim  lovely  and easy to manage  the pump has a closing feature  which works easily and does not jostle loose  so i can travel with this  also  the packaging is so slim  it does not take up much space  a little bit really does go a long way  even with my dry skin  so i truly believe i got an excellent deal for the price  i fully intend to stick with this product overall  i am really happy with it  this skincare find was the last piece in my   go budget but look and feel like i splurged   experiment  ,Positive
i had seen this on tv a few times and had high expectations but when i started using it didn t really see what the big whoop was   i was not impressed at all ,Negative
actually i was so exsited when i ordered this product that s because i resd many good reviews about it but after i got it i realy whant to ask what did they speak about      ,Negative
bought the dark blue that fades into light blue for my sister because she was begging me for it  received it about a week ago & shes never worn it  it looks fake  of course blue hair will look fake right  well this looks like plastic hair that you find on one of those cheap knock off barbie dolls at the dollar store  i knew it wouldn t look good  shes blonde  but she kept begging so i bought it ,Negative
 although the lipsticks themselves go on nicely  one came with no lipstick in the tube  the light pink one and the cases are very cheap  colors are not true to what you see  i received as a gift from my wish list ,Negative
didn t even last one time use  the thing is clearly cheap  stopping working and would not turn on after that  would not ever re purchase or recommend  save your money and boil a pot of water on the stove and shove your face on that  its more reliable than this piece of junk ,Negative
 the glove isn t worth what they charge for it and the miracles it boasts are even more of a farce  not at all worth it   go to the drugstore  but a loofa and call it a day  ,Negative
 i have fair  pinky toned skin and wear cool colors  this polish is a thicker cream  a little harder for me to apply  it is a soft  slightly pinky  light neutral  i can wear this polish with any of my clothes and never have a clash  being a light color  tiny chips or tip wear are not so noticible i have used one coat alone  without base  when i just had t get my nails done to go out of the house  it gives a very soft barely there cover to bare nails i didn t get to buffing and looking decent  normally  this would be 2 coats  that go on a bit thick  over base coat  and a clear top coat  a very light  finished look i really like i love opi polishes because beside wearing well  there is a complexity or depth to all their colors  never a like slapping on house paint look  ,Positive
i have not yet received this product but i know village naturals do not test on animals   and  makes lots of bubbles,Negative
this is the first dry shampoo i try and it works great for me make my hair fresh and clean and soft very good i order two more bottles,Positive
 whenther you have dermatitis of the scalp issues or simply want a squeaky clean shampoo on those  poo days  this is a very nice medical grade product  a lot of long hair lovers  insert shout out here like this one a lot  b++ a  ,Positive
i purchased maybelline new york volum  express waterproof mascara locally for $5  i don t like it  it has clumped each time i used it  it s hard to get my lashes to look full because they re too clumpy  the brush is gently curved & very flexible  the most flexible mascara wand i ve ever used  all mascaras i ve used in the past will clean the brush off as you pull the wand out of the tube  the opening is too big in the volum  express tube so the excess mascara isn t removed from the brush which might be the reason for the clumping  i won t purchase this again this mascara is waterproof as advertised  i use baby oil to remove waterproof mascara  petroleum jelly will work too ,Negative
i like this product  i only wish it came in a larger bottle  did not harm brush bristles  i m not sure of its disinfectant properties though ,Negative
this is okay  i m not overly thrilled with the cleaner  i think you would do just as well to drop some dawn detergent in a plastic  disposable  cup and swish the brushes around  then rinse  i did like the sleeves that came with this to keep your bristles from bending and getting out of shape  just don t think this was worth the money ,Negative
it works great worth every penny i spent on it and it cleans very fast with using only a small amount of product,Positive
 so  this is probably going to be the longest review i ve ever done  my purple coif story  i had wanted a wig of color for a long time  i put a lot of thought into it  it took me a long time     several weeks to nail down the color   green is my favorite color  kind of martian looking   blue is pretty   i wear a lot of black  and purple goes nice with black  so i decided on the dark purple  such a nice royal color or so i thought      seen in the picture so it arrived really fast  i was so excited   i tore open the package  and the first thing i notice was the color   already  i m thinking  well  i ll give it darker purple roots with my sharpie  that will look cool   i ll make do   i m easy to please like that  i was disappointed but     i d figure it out  it wasn t that expensive   then i get it out  and shake it  it s so long and pretty  super long  i m 5 2&#34  and it s way down to my hips  that s ok  i love them long   so it s a bit  disheveled  from being in the box  so i grab my wide toothed wig comb  and start at the bottom  working my way up    holding the wig against me  and huge chunks of hair begin to come out   &#34 well    it s just from being manufactured  they always shed just a bit when they re new  then they settle  down &#34   comb a bit more    more wads of hair   i put her on my mannequin head and get my soft wig brush  and brush gently from bottom to top   hair  hair    huge clumps all over the floor   i just cried   so disappointed  mostly because of the time i put into the purchase so  now by the time i ve done all this  it s not in any condition to even return  so i just throw it in the top of the guest room closet   if you don t mind massive shedding  and you re not picky about the shade  it should be fine for you  ,Positive
 i can t use this shampoo  it smells like medicine to me  i love strong herbal smells  but this doesn t seem to be the normal herbally smell  i really wanted to love this shampoo  but i can t  even my husband thinks my hair smells gross    it is the strongest smelling shampoo i have ever purchased  ,Positive
 this olay bodywash is really nice   i am pretty picky about the products i use and was very happy with this bodywash   here is my review rundown scent smell   mild  almost buttery and slightly sweet   for female mostly some men may like it~ very pleasant~ does not interfere with my perfumetexture   creamy  thick  not greasy  small latherresult   softer skin  moisturized  better looking skin overall after a few days use  not shimmeryclaim   product says it has   tone enriching ribbons of moisture & mineral shimmer  the ribbon is the print on the outside  it is actually just one thick soap moisturizer that softens & moisturizes ~ it does   as for the mineral shimmer  it is ever so slight which i like  no obnoxious glitter i wasn t expecting much but am very impressed with this soap  my skin feels so much better and much more moisturized stepping out of the shower   i will surely continue to use this product   happy bathing      ,Positive
 doesn t smell the best  and i left it in for 45 minutes with the plastic cap on and the only color change was my scalp turning orange  my hair is exactly the same color as before i applied the henna cream  my hair was natural  no dye or anything  all natural dirty blonde hair and still dirty blonde after applying the henna  ,Negative
i have the conair 1 1 4 inch hot brush but my hair is very thick and long so i wanted a bigger barrell   this was all i could find  i read all reviews before i purchased and people either loved it or hated it   if you have the conair first you will hate this brush   if you have nothing to compare it to i guess it would be ok   the cool tip at the end is too small and i kept burning my finger tips   the on off switch is right where your hand goes so you have to keep switching it back on   it does not get hot enough   if you have a lot of hair don t waste your money   i ve gone back to using my conair   wish it was bigger but it always makes my hair look great  i donated mine to a thrift store   i paid for shipping and by the time i paid to have it shipped back it just wasn t worth it   whoever buys it will probably pay 2 dollars for it and that is about what is was worth to me   someone please come out with a 1 1 2 inch hot brush    ,Negative
 i initially purchased this with intent to use it for my hair  argan oil is much too heavy and biosilk contains alcohol which is drying  therefore  i opted for this oil thinking it would be light and have a lovely smell  first off  it has absolutely no noticeable scent and most importantly  even with the tiniest amount used  it leaves my hair looking so greasy and dirty which i absolutely hate  it serves of no use for hair whatsoever in my opinion  unless you want to look like you have greasy  very stringy hair  for the price  i didn t want to just leave it sitting there occupying space  so i ve been using it to moisturize my face and skin  especially after a shower and it does a very lovely job of that  but for $18   it s a severely overpriced moisturizer  ,Negative
i had been looking for this product in many places and was so happy i found it  it works great,Positive
 loss of money  with great expectations i tried the product but did not work the curler  i have long lashes  without any curve  my lashes are completely straight  the curler did not work for me i did not get any curve  and the results are disastrous lashes  i think i would work another kind of curling as one with traditional type  such as scissor but heat  for me it was a bad purchase  the product did not fulfill my expectations p&eacute rdida de dinero  con muchas expectativas prob&eacute  el producto pero el rizador no me funcion&oacute    yo tengo las pesta&ntilde as  largas  sin alguna curva  son totalmente rectas  el rizador no funcion&oacute  para mi al probar el rizador t&eacute rmico  not&eacute  que no obtuve alguna curva  y el resultado son pesta&ntilde as desastrozas y las puntas abiertas  creo que me funcionar&iacute a otro tipo de rizador como uno con forma tracional  como tipo tijera pero t&eacute rmico  para mi fue una mala compra  el producto no llen&oacute  mis expectativas  ,Negative
 i love sandalwood  and this smells like a very pure form of it   it s almost a bit too sharp  it is my everyday lotion  the lotion itself is nice   not too heavy or oily the order came fast and well packaged  ,Positive
 you get what you pay for   the texture is very nice but the cap is a joke   there s a crease down the inside crown when on the head  and the adjusters inside don t accomplish what they should   i e  like other more expensive wigs   this might be suitable for a kid s costume or for use in theater but as something to wear out in public  forget it   the grandkids have a new play toy for  dress up   ,Negative
 my daughter asked me to get a set of these for her hair and since the last time i tried curling i got burned with the curling iron  and have some pretty nightmarish memories of getting perms as a kid  i decided to go for it and see if they worked after some trial and error  if you are new to the whole &#34 curlformer&#34  thing  definitely go to youtube and check out the videos  we figured it out  the trick is to have slightly damp hair and do the curls in small  well combed segments  i will admit that i was hoping we could get huge segments of hair into each curler but they aren t made that way  you have to do little sections in each curler  so it does take time but  lo and behold  when we were done she had a beautiful head of bouncy curls  she was delighted be warned  these aren t quick  it took well over an hour to get all her hair into the curlers once we got the process down  and they aren t comfortable  but very few curlers are  i have memories of sleeping in those bendable foam sticks in high school   but they do work very well  if you are patient and don t mind the time it takes to get the curlers in  ,Positive
color is okay  it made my hair a medium brown shade and it did seem to have highlights as advertised  it really dried my hair out and damaged it  it has a strong chemical scent and my hair was shedding out twice as much as it usually does after i used this dye ,Negative
the color is not strong enough or shiny enough   it is just not a good fit for me    that is the only reason i gave it a star ,Negative
 i am new to the flat iron hair care stuff  i had no idea that price mattered  i thought it was all hype and that hair stylists did some sort of voodoo magic when i got my hair done  some sort of secret magic that i could never do at home  so i always bought the cheapest one and wondered why my hair never looked like it did when i came home from the salon i just got this one in the mail 1 2 hour ago and immediately plugged it in to try it out   the first thing i noticed is there is a digital read out on the side so you can choose the temp you want   the guide that comes with it tells you which temps are good for different types of hair so you don t damage your hair   i adjusted it to my hair style and temp and waited for it to heat up   it took about 1 minute and it was ready   i could tell immediately a difference in my hair   my hair is thick  curly wavy and gets frizzy very easily  plus it never looks shiny   i quickly ran this through my hair and my hair looks beautiful   it looks like i just came home from the salon   it s super silky  very shiny and looks professionally   i will never use a cheap flat iron again  this one is worth every penny and then some even better  i am leaving for europe on friday and it is world voltage meaning i can use it overseas  with an adapter that i already have for my other electronics    so now i can have   good hair   no matter where i am even if you ve never had luck with hair straighteners  try this one  you won t be disappointed  i certainly am not  ,Negative
looks nothing like the picture shown  very few of the pearl decorations in package  will not order this product again ,Negative
 this did not work for me   not sure if this is a proven product or not  but i wished i hadn t made this purchase   i did not use it as often as recommended  but did use it every time and did not see any difference   to be honest  what worked for me was taking biotin every day   that supplement will make your hair grown noticeably   after three months you will have probably twice your normal growth or more depending on your dosage  ,Negative
i was looking for an all natural approach for my health and beauty needs   i had a few breakouts on my jaw line and ran out of my acne spot treatment and decided to give this item a try   this did not help treat any of my break outs and made my jawline and chin break out even more   i gave this item a try for two weeks and finally gave up and bought something else that was able to clear my skin up ,Negative
   crown me already     silver sparkle with various size glitter particles   this polish is amazing and got tons of comments  even from a guy that worked at lowe s  three coats are needed to get a solid diamond like glitter from the nails  but after three days it started to chip off two of my nails  even with seche vite topcoat  the biggest problem i had was removal  this polish simply does not want to come off  even if you use a basecoat  it took nearly thirty minutes of intense scrubbing with pure acetone to finally remove the polish  and by that point my nails literally hurt  it is amazing but i will think twice about wearing this by itself again  this would not be good for a diamond tip french manicure as some of the sparkles are quite large  it made the edges of my nails deadly sharp and my boyfriend complained that i was scratching him  i even scratched my own face a few times  ,Negative
 this is a very nice and pleasant tanning oil  the oil itself doesn t have any color  used it a couple of times onyl  so i can t say anything about getting tan with it  stopped using it when i noticed that its main ingredient is a mineral oil  why mineral oil is bed for you skin   your skin is the body s largest organ  and it works together with the kidneys to rid the body of toxins  however  your skin needs to be able to breathe to perform these functions  kim anderson  a health care consultant to arbonne international  states that   mineral oil coats the skin like plastic wrap  disrupting the skin s natural immune barrier and inhibiting its ability to breathe and absorb the  natural moisture factor   moisture and nutrition     in addition  mineral oil attracts needed moisture from cells deep inside your skin  this means that cell renewal is slowed  collagen breaks down  and the connective tissue is destroyed  normal cell development is slowed down and the skin ages prematurely when skin cells are robbed of moisture read more        ,Positive
 i have used this lotion for years  i only bought this lotion b c of the reviews on here  when normally i bite the bullet and buy it in a salon  i have bought many lotions off of amazon and have never been ripped off  until now  very upset  i gave it a benefit of the doubt and used it a few times a week for a few weeks and it was not the same as the oens in the salon  texture  smell  color  everything  its a knock off  very pissed  lesson learned  people dont write negative reviews for no reason  and there are more than one  i have been tanning for 15 yrs and have been previously a co owner of a salon     so i am full of knowledge when it comes to tanning beds  and lotions  and this ladies and gentleman is not the real deal  save your money  time  etc  dooooooooooo notttttttttt order  ,Negative
 i really wanted to like this  especially after it was highly recommended  but     it was very clumpy goopy   i can handle that  i applied it very carefully  used a fine tooth eye brush comb to comb out clumps and used my beauty blender to carefully clean up any &#34 mess&#34  left by the very thick and difficult to use brush  what i couldn t handle was the &#34 eye buggers&#34  it left in the inside corners of my eyes every time i ve used this and that it smudged smeared very badly after about 4=5 hrs of wear every single time i wore it   the reason i gave it 2 starts is that its not all bad       it  did dramatically plump up my very thin sparse lashes  really did look like i had on false lashes  will use this for special occasions  knowing i will need to take frequent trips to the ladies room to monitor its wear  and be prepared for touch ups   for every day use i will continue with my bare minerals mascara  ,Negative
 doesn t peel off well    i usually have to scrub it off  which defeats the entire purpose  i wouldn t get it again  would prefer other brands i ve used before  ,Negative
 to all of those who care about quality skincare this is an amazing product  when i picked it up from my post office i put it on my hand and it absorbed quickly and my hand was instantly and incredibly smooth and soft  i then applied it to my neck and the same result  i will be purchasing the retinol next  when i purchased this vitamin c serum from azure naturals contacted me just to say thank you  can you believe that   when does a company ever reach out with a personal touch  that never happens  before i received my product jamie offered me a 20% discount on my next order  if you contact them they get right back to you and not make you wait for days  i really like this company and their vitamin c serum  i cannot wait to buy the retinol  try it honestly you won t be disappointed  and if for any reason you are from my brief experience already i am confident that they will help you  this is a company that takes pride in their product line and cares about their customers  what more could anyone want or expect  great product  great company  nice people to do business with  ,Positive
 this stuff works great   you just need a little bit   i spray once on my left side  once on my left and once in the back and brush it through  when i m done blow drying my hair  i have no more frizz or static in my hair   it s sooooo soft    i have oily hair  that s why i use just a tiny bit  i can see if i were to use more then a tiny bit  it would look greasy  i love touching my hair  running my fingers through it   baby soft   i would think if you have real dry hair you would put a little more on then me  but still you don t need much  this bottle should last me a long time  plus it wash my hair every 4 days  hope my review helped    have a great day   ,Positive
it laste a long time and i use it for my afro texture hair  it was great it created alot of new growth when use properly ,Positive
 i have been wearing sunblock everyday since i was in my teens  and this is my favorite   it is a bit pricey  but the bottle will last for a long time   this is a great price  and i will be purchasing this again  ,Positive
 lots of brushes with a wide variety of applications  unaffected by even pure acetone  perfect for detailed nail art designs ,Positive
my hair is definitely thicker and it helps smooth it down too  the grape smell is alright too but my hairspray usually masks it anyway,Positive
 i generally use benefit s you rebel lite under philosophy s supernatural in natural ivory  i wanted to leave a   necessities   makeup kit at my boyfriends house but didn t want to spend the money to buy a new one of all of my fairly expensive products knowing i wouldn t be using them on a regular basis  i should have shelled out the money for my benefit product  i have never used a bb cream before  and in all honesty was hoping it would be similar to my tinted moisturizer     and it was  i like the feel of it  i have combination skin and it doesn t leave me oily or dry  it doesn t make me break out like some moisturizers i ve used  the problem is  it s too dark  i m fairly pale  but not porcelain  and this is too dark for me  i have to blend it way down my neck and be really careful using it so i don t have a line  and then just make sure i don t wear a white shirt   i will be purchasing my old standby and throwing this one away  if the color matched  i d be all about it though  it lasted all day and felt nice on my skin  ,Negative
 after several weeks of using this product  i actually can say it made my skin look worse  i was using a light murad lotion before  and when i ran out i switched to the product exclusively to really give it a thorough test my first thought it that both lotions in the package felt strange and the day lotion itself was a bit too oily and heavy  i hated how greasy my face looked and felt  but i applied them as directed and hoped for the best with a few days  my skin looked a lot more bumpy  and wrinkles were more evident  then two weeks later  blackheads and zits started appearing  and so that was the end of it  it absolutely did not remove any signs of aging  or smooth my skin  my main concern is pigment and sun damage  i m a competitive swimmer and even though i wear sunblock  i still get freckles and tan on my face  followed by fine lines and wrinkles  and this product did absolutely nothing for me  if anything  it seemed to magnify all the little wrinkles and puffy spots on my face i ve been trying different things with my skin for years now  and usually have the best luck with a combination of murad lotions in the day and rx prescriptions  retin a and hydroquinone  at night  i was hoping this might be a good  lower cost alternative to the murad stuff i use  but the fact that it made me skin look worse really astounds me maybe if you need serious moisture  this product is too rich for me  and have deep wrinkles  it might work  but if you have fine wrinkles  a normal complexion  and need a light lotion  skip this  ,Negative
 i am happy to report that in just a few days  a very bad acne breakout that i have been fighting for like a year on my forehead and nothing was working finally is just about clear   for months i had like 10 pimples in various stages of healing at any given time and just when some would start to clear up  new ones were always popping up   i just thought i couldn t win and that it was time to accept that i have adult acne and that i should just start getting used to it  well  in just the past few days that i started this  no new acne has developed  the 5 that were about to pop did and then didn t come back  and the two deep cystic ones are going down   once these two cystic ones are gone  i will finally be clear for once in such a long time    what i like about this is that it hasn t dried me out or irritated my skin  the texture is very nice and light and absorbs quickly  and interestingly enough  has not contributed to hyperpigmentation   every other bp product i have tried just wasn t worth it because of the hyperpigmentation  but this product my acne has been healing quite nice   i hope the good progress continues oh and i think the advice in   the regimen   makes a big difference too   being uber gentle with your skin  who knew that was key to the cure   everyone else always wants to scrub or peel your face off and do extractions   i m so glad that this has made such a difference   2 weeks later my skin is completely clear  i now need to deal with the acne scars but at least now i don t have inflamed pustules  cystic acne  and popped pimples in various stages of healing all over my forehead   amazing stuff   i did have a few days of excessive dryness and then a day of thick dry plaque dryness when started to become a little overzealous with use  so i reduced the dosage for two days and then gently exfoliated the dry skin off and voila  nice clear skin and no more pimples   don t skimp on the moisturizer while using this stuff oh  and invest in a pack of 14 white face towels   add them to your cart now  use a fresh and clean towel with each wash  and just do laundry once per week   i also think this contributed to my skin clearing up   always use a clean towel  ,Positive
 i borrowed this straightener from a friend a while back and loved it so i had to get my own   it works great and my hair actually stays pretty stratight all day long  unlike my maxiglide that i bought from tv a while back that would straighten my hair but as soon as any type of moister hit  it would crinkle   i will continue to use my remington at this point  its pretty quick and painless  ,Positive
it was broken when received    very unhappy when i received this product   won t be ordering products any longer   and it was not solid at all ,Negative
 i bought my item in the local drugstore  but have seen no results in the three weeks i ve been using the product  i hoped for more   instead  no lift  not smoothing  yet another eye cream that goes to   i had high hopes   pile  it is  however  moisturizing  ,Negative
this had really good reviews on this stuff but it did nothing for my hair at all total waste of money for me ,Negative
there were many positive comments about this product   i have been using it two times a day for several weeks and did not get the results that was expected it did not work for me  i am going to try another product because it has a good rating this is the first time that i gave a poor rating on any product  i buy a lot from amazon and have been very happy with the products that i  order ,Negative
as much is i absolutely love this product there is one con  not ideal for really long nails  which i don t have but plan on growing out my nails   other than that there are so many designs on this plate for your heart s desires  check out some youtube videos and you ll see how amazing this product is   also google some pictures  i also recommend nail striping tapes  pretty soon you ll be making some awesome designs  highly recommend for average nail length and shorter ,Positive
maybe it is just my hair  everyone else seems to love this  i do have short hair and what i was looking for was a product that gave me just one wave  this poofs out my hair and creates for of a crimp  i tried both settings and it still does the same thing  then it makes my ends look weird when i did not even use it on my ends this is my 2nd bed head waver and i am giving up until my hair gets longer  they should make one smaller for those with short hair ,Negative
 i was so excited to try this product based on the reviews    and it is not as good as the reviews   i m mixed caribbean   cuban  jamaican  and puerto rican   a lot of people think i m dominican because of my hair  medium length  about 4 inches past the shoulder   based on my experience  this product is not a good detangler at all  most leave in conditioners i have used are good detanglers  expect to use another product to detangle first before applying it if you so desire  expect to have very small white flakes if you mess with your hair once this product dries  i would only recommend this product if you wash your hair everyday  not 1 3 times a week like many people with ethnic mixed hair like me   expect your hair to look dull   you must add another product if you want shine the first time i used this product  after shampoo & condition with mizani products   i tried a roller   wet set with this mixed chicks product with 20 minutes under a hooded ionic hair dryer  neutral air temp  not hot     when i removed the rollers the hair was so stiff like it had gel in it  it looked horrible so i had to spray water on my hair to soften it   then proceeded to detangle the hair again with a mason pearson detangling comb   next i let the hair air dry for nearly 3 hours  and the product still wasn t dry  i couldn t believe it     so i did a dominican blow out  the hair was finally looking decent yet it was not shiny and it only gained volume because of the brush i used  i had to add other products for shine  semi di lino diamante   because this product was not successful at moisturizing the hair  the only thing i did find good about this product is that it leaves the hair feeling soft and almost weightless after it dries so   this product must only be good for you to toss it in your hair after washing it without any detangling and just leave it in    so that you look like mel b g  scary spice  back in the day   because thats what my hair looked like when i used this mixed chicks leave in conditioner and didn t detangle the hair and just applied it and waited all day for the product to dry   in conclusion do not     i repeat do not use this product if you plan on detangling  roller wet setting  blow dry  wrapping  or doing a dominican blow out only use this product as if it were mousse on wet hair and let it air dry all day long  ,Negative
super great find in comparison to the beauty blender sponges  they are practically the same,Positive
 this is my all time blending brush that i reach for first if i need to do some serious blending   it says this is small  but for me  it s one of my biggest blending brushes since my eyes are small   the brush itself it great  ,Positive
this pigment was not that good  the mac version is much more pricey but worth it  the color barely showed up on my eyelid  even with a primer  was very hard to get out of the bottle with my eyeshadow brush  it was cheap but not worth it ,Negative
 i love all the images on these plates  i ordered all the plates in this collection  i notice another review that said some of the images didn t transfer well and i have to say that it may be the stamper not the plate  i have the konad stamper and the winstonia stamper and i find that if an image does not transfer well i try the other stamper  the konad stamper is very firm and the winstonia stamper is super squishy  so it really makes a difference sometimes what kind of stamper you are using  also  the polish makes a huge difference  i have tried many  stamping polish and regular polish  my favorites are konad polish  sally hansen insta dry polish and pure ice metallics  i have never had an issue with any of the images on any of the cheeky plates  once you get one of these you will want them all  i must also mention that if you are wondering which stamper to get i would get one of each for sure  the konad double end stamper and the winstonia stamper  i use the winstonia stamper about 90% of the time  but some of the more intricate images with a lot of tiny detail need the more firm stamper to get a sharp crisp image  also the size of these plates in my opinion are perfect  not too large and the plastic backing prevents the plate from warping   hope this helps   ,Positive
 i am in the beginning of 30s  and started to notice all the wrinkles and experimented with different stuff    then i came across the advertisement of  lifecell   and purchased one  it does not worth the money  i don t see what they claim  and after 2 months of using this product only since it claims to be the all in one skin care  i started to notice my wrinkles on the forehead is starting to come back  getting worse the surface of my skin seems to stay smooth  but other than that i really don t see what this product is doing for the money i paid for  i am discontinuing the use of lifecell and go back to my usual combination of creams and serums  when it sounds too good to be true  you know what when you purchase the first box  it will automatically sign you up for the automatic future shipment  so make sure you pay attention to it  also  if you want to return for money back as they claim  you need to keep the box    i wish i did  ,Negative
 unlike any other false eyelashes  this false eyelashes is extremely uncomfortable  it s too long  hard & thick & it s not soft & seems like it made out of fake feathers  overall  i m not satisfied  ,Negative
 in general  i think toners are a waste of time this is going to sound stupid  but the graphics on the bottle were the primary attraction   i came across this product at a a natural health foods store in the area   alcohol free   i like that too   i ve been steaming my face a couple of times a week  and thought this would be a good way to remove excess cleanser and close my pores i really like the scent  texture  it s a bit moisturizing   and how it preps my skin before my moisturizer  i use jojoba oil    i have not had any problems with irritation  and have been using it at least twice a day for 3 5 months on my drier  hormonal acne prone skin   if i m going to mess with a toner  this will be the one i use  ,Negative
does not hold my hair  yes it is a bit thick and wavy   broke on the 3rd wear  it may be cheap but its still a waste of money ,Negative
 the air compressor came scratched up  i wonder if the item was used  returned and restocked  even on high  not much came of of the air brush  when it did come out it was huge splatter  not a fine mist  it did not cover my skin no matter how much color mixing or primer i used  after application my face felt sticky  this did not cover anything on my face  i returned mine  save your time and money and skip this  ,Negative
 this product is amazing  i wasn t quite sure if this product would do what it said that it would do  after i washed my hair  i tried putting a generous amount of this product into my hair  hoping for the best  amazingly  to my surprise  when i combed my hair i couldn t believe how it was so easy to comb though  i am african american and i have very thick  kinky  and curly hair that s very hard to comb after shampooing and using a regular leave in treatment conditioner  i have tried all kinds of leave in treatment conditioners and nothing has ever worked quite as good as this product has for my unruly type of hair  i believe that this product will work great on any other hair type as well  if this product works great on my type of hair  it will work great on yours too  i highly recommend this product to anyone that has a hard time combing out your hair after shampooing  redken  i hope you always continue to make this product  it s great  i am a customer for life  ,Positive
 so i ordered these january 27th and received them today february 28th so that s quite a while but it was worth it  i did receive product as described 10pc striping tape the colors  silver  purple  blue  red  pink  gold  white  green  sparkly gold  and sparkly purple and there is a pretty good amt of each on the roll will deff take me awhile to use it all  so all in all it was a great purchase    ,Positive
this was a huge waste of money  did not work on my oily face  i was oily after 30mins  i will not buy this again  i just tried oc 8 professional mattifying gel and i loved it  i do not recommend this product to anyone,Negative
i was able to try out this soap for free in exchange for an honest review and was happy with the results  i love the fact it is 100% natural  i can see a difference in my skin and feel a difference as well i can see the huge improvement with my acne since using this product  i recommend it ,Positive
i ve been using this about every other day because i read somewhere that high frequency can be drying   i m not sure if it s really working   i don t see drastic improvement   but it hasn t been that long so i m keeping an open mind ,Positive
 i have to admit  i m impressed by tresemme s new line of   collections   shampoos and conditioners  i ve been working my way through them all with coupons i have  but i d yet to try keratin smooth  this one is by far my favorite i have thick  wavy curly hair that frizzes nicely in humidity and in winter we have a pellet stove running all the time  so my hair dries out and becomes staticky  i reach a point where i tend to give up getting my hair to do much of anything and just use a clip to put it up all the time  hands down  i had the best hair day with keratin smooth i love the smell  it s clean  a little citrusy  a little apple y  not really overly perfumey  just nice and light  i left the conditioner in for a couple of minutes  it rinsed out nicely  then can the real test  after towel drying  used my dryer and scrunched it up so that the layers would wave and not a frizz appeared  i used a little gel for hold and it lasted all day  i never had it frizz up  and even my daughter said she d never seen my hair look that good  even after a trip to the salon i m sold  i went out and bought more bottles of tresemme shampoo  conditioner  and the styling products to make sure i have a good stock on hand just in case they discontinue it  it s new  so i doubt that will happen  but i ve had favorite products disappear before  so i m not taking chances  ,Positive
 i don t know why they call this oil control moisturizer  because it doesn t leave a matte finish on the skin nor does it remotely control oil throughout the day  i don t expect miracles  but when i apply my moisturizer and makeup at 7 am  i don t want to be shiny faced by 9 am  quite honestly  i am less shiny when i don t use this  and for over $15  that s not acceptable  ,Positive
 i use tea tree oil for bug sting bits  sores  itchy skin  wounds for healing  disinfection and sanitizing  ,Positive
 perfect size rhinestones for nail art and the case is very cute  organized and convenient to use  i love this product ,Positive
 i was very impressed with this product  i found it delivered on it s promises and the price is an excellent value for what you get  i m not sure why other reviewers found the instructions unclear  they re easy  you get 7 tubes  you put one tube on your hair every day for 7 days in a row  you can buy a new box every month and do the treatment again for 7 days each month i have extremely long hair and at first i thought that there was no way one of those little tubes was going to cut it  but i was really surprised  one tube was more than enough for my hair  if you had short hair  you could totally get away with only half a tube at a time i noticed a difference in my hair after the first day  it s shinier and softer and much easier to comb out  it s a great product at the right price point  ,Positive
i have been using and trying a lot of their color and since i have brown color hair i need tobleach it to get the right effect this one i havent used yet got a lot of complementgot it on timeif u like color u should try their products ,Positive
 i absolutely love the gel nails i get done at the salon  but the process seemed simply enough for me to try to do it at home  i ordered this set and was excited as it was supposed to come with a dvd or instructions  all that was shipped was the box with the different application bottles  which seemed damaged in shipment i had to go on youtube and research on my own to figure out how to and what to use each bottle for the foundation seems way more gummy and it will take some practice i guess on applying thinner coats  like they seem to do in the salon  but since it is the same brand my salon uses i decided to not send it back one concern i had  my nails are very healthy  but when i apply the foundation base code mind i do not omit any steps  and put it under the uv light  if burns for the first 3 seconds  i never experienced this at the nail salon since others left such positive reviews i will continue to try it out  tried it out one more time  what a disappointment  am sending the kit and the uv lamp back  the burning sensation continued  my nail tech advised something must be wrong with the gel application kit or uv lamp or both meanwhile it definitely took a toll on my nails and i definitley will go back to the salon to get my gel nails done the right way  ,Negative
 if you want to keep your skin in good shape and you re not a youngster i recommend this product   i have always trust neutrogena and with this product my trust has paid off   my skin feels great and really clean  thanks neutrogena ,Positive
 lathers nicely  feels good  only time will tell if it does all it is meant to do  the scent is very mild  not gender specific    could be used by anyone  we like it in our family  will update how the hair feels after a month or so  thanks for amazon for a chance to try it  we like tresemme products  ,Positive
 fresh light sent that brings to mind the outdoors after the rain  not a heavy lather but it goes get the body clean and does not leave an odd film on the body as this is a generous portion at nearly 17 ounces it will also last for quite a while as it takes very little  roughly the size of a half dollar to get the job done  ,Positive
 the thing i like best about this lip gloss is the color   autumn haze is a subtle  neutral shade that enhances your natural lip color but never overpowers   but those who prefer to make a bolder statement are in luck too because this gloss comes in 11 other shades ranging from the neutrals like autumn haze to pinks  reds and plums not only is it beautiful  but burt s bees is good for your lips   the list of ingredients includes sunflower oil  castor seed oil  beeswax  olive fruit oil and jojoba esters  all of which are designed to combine with other nutrients to keep your lips soft and well hydrated while it s not slick  it goes on smoothly with its sponge like applicator   it does feel slightly waxy  perhaps from the addition of beeswax in the formula  but i don t mind that  in fact  i rather like it   there s no detectable taste or scent and i find it stays on about as long as other lip glosses i ve tried   in short  it s a great substitute for lipstick  ,Positive
this product doesn t work in that a person can t get their head inside the unit where the heat comes out   very cumbersome  we bought a standing version instead and it s much better ,Negative
 i have used this quite a few times over the past month since i ve received it  and it adds a nice bit of softness to my hair  which is already pretty silky  i probably wouldn t purchase this again because of the price  unless my hair became very dry and hard to manage   which is possible since i travel periodically and am subjected to different water and weather conditions   ,Positive
 yaaaaaahoooozzzzaaa   love love love it   want it in a larger size   the results and benefits over other things i have tried are beyond   even using it on my scalp   would tell people with any skin issue including scars  psoriasis etc   try it   even though it is &#34 acid    that refers to the chemical description   it is not corrosive or abrasive   feels awesome  ,Positive
 so i looked it up   beauty balm  blemish balm  blemish base  it stated in the asain markets as an all in one cream  moisturizer foundation sunscreen i have used it in the florida winter sun on my 50 year old skin for over a month now and can t say i would buy again   my estee lauder eye coverup did a better job at all three functions for half the price more bb info from the huffington post     the key to the bb cream is to apply sparingly    generally a pea sized amount dotted on the forehead  under eyes  nose chin and cheeks and blended well into the skin is enough to provide natural looking coverage  applied with or without moisturizer underneath and some finish off with a dusting of powder  some have remarked they could replace their foundation with bb cream  where others think bb is best suited to a natural weekend look and not meant to replace full foundation  others think it works well as a primer under their regular makeup   ,Positive
 you put a pad on this  wet it  and push a button that sort of makes it vibrate a bit and wash your face with it   it s supposed to exfoliate and get you really clean  i didn t find it worked any better than washing my face any other way   i like neutrogena products as a rule  so this was a disappointment   save your money  ,Negative
 it s ok  but nothing special   a good professional brand leave in conditioner will do just as well if not better  at a lower cost   the smell isn t all that great either  ,Negative
 made me break out  red bumps then second i put it on    the retinal suppostto even out and reduce dark spots along with the vitamin c    what i seen wasthe direct opposite   it doesnt tone doesnt reduce againg   it acutally increases againg  not for me but give it a try    everyone skin respons differently   ,Negative
wish i could give this 0 stars  doesn t blend  as thick as cement  i ll keep using my $7 maybelline concealer thank you very much ,Negative
 i had originally used pssssst for brunettes after finding it in ulta   i really liked it  but when i ran out i couldn t find it anywhere   i tried a couple of others before trying the batiste brunette  but wasn t really impressed   they would do in a rush as opposed to not having anything else to use  when i found this product i wasn t sure it would be any different  but i was wrong  not only does it work as it should  it really smells nice   if you follow the instructions  imperative    and use it sparingly at each section i m sure you ll be happy with it   i have oily hair  and when necessary  ocasionally  i can go up to three days without shampooing   i normally shampoo every day   i ve read that it isn t good for the hair to shampoo every day  so when i have to skip shampoos i use this product and i m sure it s a good thing   oh   one other thing   the spray spout on every dry shampoo i ve tried would clog up ocassionally   this one is no different   when you re finished using it wash the spout before storing the can    ,Positive
 i am about to purchase my second jar of michael todd s knu     i also got it in a living social deal i am not sure why people don t like it either   i am not sure how it works  or what exactly it is doing to my face but it definitely smooths out my skin  truly leaving a silky healthy look to it   it seems to smooth out the skin  yet it isn t a moisturizer   i use moisturizer on top of it  i also have dry skin and no  i don t get the flakes that people talk about  the smell is not offensive   it kind of  yeah  glue ish  but i don t smell it anymore once i close up the jar   it isn t over powering anyway  let me put my review this way   i am about to buy another jar   i am glad i can buy it here on amazon and not spend $150  but if i had to spend $150 i would   no joke   i really like how it leaves my skin looking     it also seems to get better and better as i use it  ,Positive
 highly recommend this lotion for foot massages  it goes on a little &#34 wet&#34  but is soon rubbed in and doesn t leave feet feeling all greasy and nasty  but very smooth and satiny  the smell is good  not too strong  but pleasant  some lotions are overwhelming  but this one is not  light lemony scent with just a hint of coconut beneath it great price for this bottle too  nice to not spend $9 99 on a little tiny bottle of lotion  this is a full 32 ounces  and seems to last a long time without researching it too deeply  the ingredients all appear to be pretty innocuous  and it s free of lots of things like parabens   polysorbate  edta  etc  my husband and i try to massage each others feet and upper back every night  so it s important for us to not use lotions full of harmful chemicals we have used a lot of lotions and oils through the years  and i have to say  this lotion pleases us both  so we will continue to use it  we like it as well as the sacred earth massage cream we used to us  next order  we will try the other scents too  ,Positive
lineur intense felt tip carbon black eyeliner  i like the smooth way that it glides on but i am so dissapointed in the product because it starts to flake off as soon as it drys  before i even get out the door of my home it s already started flaking  i have never had a problem like this with a l oreal product before ,Negative
 i fell in love with the color and the style in the picture  however  there were clumps of hair falling out when i pulled it out of the bag it came in  i hated the thought of sending it back but couldn t risk wearing it out and finding clumps of hair on my clothes or in my food  i got an ok to return it but then the return address label said i had to pay for shipping it back to china  instead i threw it away since i had already lost enough money i wasn t going to invest more in a bad decision to buy the wig in the first place  ,Negative
first off i was desperate for an acne medication  i searched acne on amazon and this came out first  i searched it up and bought it at vitamin store for 6 49$  it works so well    it really does pulse  the formula i do  1 tablespoon clay mix 1 tablespoon raw apple cider vinegar  this will make more than enough clay mixture for your face  i will do an update on this in about a week ,Positive
 for those who ve actually read what the product is supposed to do  it s meant to be a boost to your hair  it s not really meant to detangle  and if you follow the directions  you will see the results after a shower  i massage this into my roots  just like you re supposed to  and it does help to detangle my hair  yes  it s not the greatest at detangling  but it s just a boosting leave in spray  i sleep with it in  and when i wake up in the morning  i have noticed some instant results  my hair at the roots looks plain healthy  it s shiny  and ultra smooth  i have frizzy hair that normally looks dry  but after i started using this spray  the difference was instant it does have a smell  like eucalyptus and mint crossed together  which is rather pleasant  and leaves my hair smelling a bit like i just came from the salon overall  i have noticed a big difference in the texture of my hair on the nights that i use this  and the nights that i don t  it s meant to be a leave in spray to boost your roots  and for me  it s definitely a staple  ,Positive
 i have nail polish that does not dry quickly  instead of doing the girlie hand phial thing or placing my hands i front of a fan  i just place 1 or 2 drops on each nail and within a few seconds  my nails are instantly dry  i recommend using this on nails with 2 coats of polish anything more and it tends to smear the underplaying coats leaving bad indentations on your nails causing you only to repeat the process again  jilly ,Positive
works and smells great  makes my skin incredibly soft  recommend to those wanting something a little cheaper to get the job done ,Positive
this little gadget really works good on your skin    this is my first time trying it  thanks    it  s good on cleaning your skin and pores ,Positive
 i used fekkai prx oil very sparingly  i put just a bit in the palm of my hands  rubbed it to warm it and applied it directly to the bottom half of my hair after combing out all the tangles  i lightly combed through once again and let it air dry  once it was dry  i saw little difference in the feel of my hair  and did look a bit limper  as if it had lost some of the fullness of freshly washed hair  the next day  upon returning home from work  i looked in the mirror and was very disappointed to find that my hair looked like it needed to be washed again  it didn t look dirty  but it looked like the fresh look of just done hair was all gone  not what i am looking for in a hair product  bummer on the packaging  very  very classy looking  the cardboard outer package and the inside glass bottle have a fabulous appearance  however  the cap bottle leaks  and when you are dealing with oil that is really a problem  secondly  the little wand inside will be useless when the product gets close to the bottom  positive note  the scent is fabulous all factors considered  this is not a product i will purchase  there are way too many others out there that perform better and will not take the fresh appearance away from my hair on the first day  ,Negative
 this is fantastic mascara   i like the brown even though i have very dark brown  almost black hair  because the brown is softer looking   i like my makeup to not be too artificial looking   if i only apply one coat of this  it comes out so natural looking that i think it could fool people into thinking i just have really nice eyelashes   three coats and my lashes almost look like false eyelashes  they are so long and thick  but still separated   i don t know why it s called smudgeproof  it really is waterproof and a bit hard to remove with my regular facial cleanser   great stuff  anyway   i hope they never discontinue it  ,Positive
i was expecting a fresh and sweet scent and was greatly disappointed  i think the scent is too   mature and a tad too musky ,Negative
 the problem with a lot of   organic   hair products is that they really don t do a very good job at hydrating the hair  this product left my hair dry  brittle and coarse feeling  i will not be using this product again  ,Negative
 the spray is ok     at least for the first two days  after that the nozzle was completely stuck  the spray is hard as glue  could not even open it up with a knife  so if you are looking for glueing or cementing something  this is your product  if you want an easy product that detangles  then think twice  i am returning the product  ,Negative
 got a sample in the mail of the new ever sleek shampoo  conditioner  and leave in conditioner   the shampoo and conditioner were   fine   meaning  they didn t do anything special for my hair  nothing as promised on the bottle   just   fine   the leave in treatment on the other hand   hated it  sticky  greasy  yucky mess  i added a pea size amt to my palm and smoothed it all over my hair concentrating on the ends like it suggested  it even looks like lotion  it is thick and white  when i went to style it  it wouldn t dry  i blew it dry and combed it out  it felt like i had a glob of lotion in my hair  it was sticky  and would not hold curl on the ends like i normally style it  it looks ok but when you touch it  it just feels gross and greasy  i threw the rest of the sample away  i never want this junk in my hair again   i will stick with the nice spray leave in treatments i have been using thank you very much i guess if you have really frizzy coarse hair  you may like this stuff  but if you have fine slighly frizzy hair or if you plan to put a curling iron thru your hair do not use this  you probably won t like it i  m happy i didn t pay for a full size  ,Negative
the texture is waxy and just sits a top your lips  the color is not flattering on olive skin either   it is really well pigmented but lookslike you took paint to your lips and it just sits there ,Negative
 i had to send this back  as was too heavy for my wrist and rotator cuff problems   thought it was reviewed as lightweight   might work out fine for other people  ,Negative
what can i say this is great conditioner  people always notice my gray silver hair  they always tell me how great it looks  shinny and no yellowing  if you got to have gray hair you might as well make it work for you ,Negative
 lies lies lies  i shouldn t have believed these positive reviews   this is like mascara from early 90s or something  just black stain on your lashes  that put your lashes together and clump  oh yes it s waterproof so it gets a one star  thats the only good thing about it    it definitely isn t pretty     and no it does not add any volume  wasted my money thank u very much  sigh  i want my money backkkkkkkkkk   grrrrrrrr and i bought this for my wedding    d &lt i should ve gotten l oreal voluminous waterproof mascara instead       ,Negative
 these were pretty cheap  but i figured it would be ok just to practice acrylic nails on boy was i wrong  first off when i opened the package they were in a dirty old zip lock bag  no receipt  i have always received a receipt with my order   its really hard to work on a nail when the nail doesn t stay  will probably not repurchase  ,Negative
 i use this every time i wash a co wash an it works great  not sticky doesn t make my hair feel heavy  leaves it very light  smells nice  i recommend to anyone who is natural an needs a too leave in for dry hair  ,Positive
 step 1 and 2 are okay  but step 3 is so drying that my face can t handle it   this system dried out my skin too much   i would recommend this for men and women who are not prone to dry skin  ,Negative
 it was not at all helpful to my skin  i am a person that used to look for answers to skin problems and this was not it  i found my answer but  it is not rosewater  this sits under my sink and maybe i ll mix it with my indian clay or something  may work for some but  not me  ,Negative
 i have oily skin  so bought this foundation due to the reviews that it improved the appearance of skin and provided good coverage   the consistency was silicone like  so settled into my pores accentuating them   after the first application  it didn t even look like i had make up on  so i applied another layer  which didn t make a bit of a difference   also  the product must have gotten to near my eye because it burned  and made my eye blurry   it was so uncomfortable  i ended up taking the make up off    i ll be returning it for something that does what i need  ,Negative
 we have been using this for years on our grandson s hair   this is simple to use as it sprays on and it is a gentle formula that is tear free and easy on his eyes   we applied it normally to his wet hair after a shower but sometimes when he took his shower before he went to bed this was the answer to bed head in the morning it quickly detangled his hair and made it easy to comb or brush   it also has a nice fragrance and even my wife has used it on occasion   the only problem we have is that now he has a burr haircut for the summer and we don t need to use this  at least for a while  ,Positive
 this product not only didn t cover gray  but it didn t grab my hair at all   not worth the price and special order  ,Negative
 after reading all the positive reviews i was so hopeful  my nails have always peeled  been weak thin and brake chip easily  used this product for several weeks  as directed and it did not make one bit of difference  no change what so ever     ,Negative
 i just switched to this product after using a more expensive face cream for some time now this is a much more affordable option and so far is working great i have very dry  acne prone skin so finding a face cream that is moisturizing enough but won t make me break out is a nightmare  this seems to do the trick  it smells great  feels great going on and keeps my face hydrated all day long  it is a little greasy  but since my skin is so dry that is not an issue for me   others may like it only as a night cream due to the greasiness  ,Positive
i only &#34 tried&#34  to use it maybe 3 times and it won t even come on anymore  the top part won t stay connected to the bottom after putting the batteries inside  the bits don t even file nails very well  i hate that i wasted money on this,Negative
i dont care for this product because it does not work  i have used other eyelid primers that worked better  when i used this it was like i put foundation on my eye lids ,Negative
bought this because i was starting to do my own nails   it saved some time over using a hand file but            i only used it about 6 times and it stopped working   glad it didn t cost too much but still out a few bucks    not happy ,Negative
 i did my eyebrows as usual  as in  filled them in with pencil and powder then  i put this product on over my brows  and nothing my brows just look coated in clear gel  but do not stay in place  i arch my brows upwards but my natural brows tend to slope downwards  i bought this to keep them up but it didn t work at all  it made no difference other than making them more glossy which i don t like  i prefer matte brows not attractive and not worth the money  ,Negative
 i wish i read the other reviews before i bought this  i would have never bought this shampoo had i known it had moisture beads in it  i use a shampoo to wash things out of my hair not add odd things too it  the beads stay in your hair   plus it s really thick and not in a thick and rich and creamy way but thick like a hair gel paste way and it s hard to lather its so thick  it was hard to rinse out and left my hair feeling like straw and knotted  i literally couldn t comb my hair with a wide tooth comb after using this there were visible knots in my hair  i have thin flat hair and this made it much worse plus all knotted and dry  gross  i felt like i needed to get right back in the shower  never again  ,Negative
 i had really high expectations for this product but unfortunately my skin did not respond well to this at all   i have dry sensitive skin with very mild rosacea and bubzbeauty mentioned this product in one of her youtube videos   i use a lot of asian products such as cure  juju aquamoist and hada labo which are all great for sensitive and dry skin   this one didn t work for me  it irritated my skin and caused it to flare up   it is very moisturizing and hydrating but if you have sensitive skin  i wouldn t recommend it to you  ,Negative
 this brush is so soft  so dense and it is so pretty to look at  the quality is amazing  i had no plan as to what i was going to use this brush for  i just wanted it  it is a multi tasker in my brush collection  it really gives foundation a air brushed finish   i also like using it with setting powder or with my tarte amazoian clay 12 hour powder foundation   it s a multi purpose brush and i am so happy to own it  ,Positive
 applying the foam was easy and neater than liquid color  however i am embarrassed to leave the house now  where my hair was gray is now bright red and the rest of it is dark brown  i can only imagine how i look in the sunlight  i hope this color fades quickly  ,Negative
 i understand they are probably not meant for everyday use but for the price i thought i d order them anyways  came fast  but the box was all tore up and the lashes smelled like chemicals  they are really stiff  and made of plastic  not too mention really  really long   not too happy  but hey for the price i can t complain too much  you get what you pay for  buy at your own risk   ,Positive
 just starting using it  it feels nice on the lashes   i will have to give it a couple of days to review it  ,Positive
this perfume smells so beautiful   will wear everyday  the scent  seems to be long lasting  will purchase again in the future ,Positive
 i like cleansing wipes  and tried these because of the price  however  they are not very good at removing makeup  i ve gone back to the other olay daily facial cloths  which are much more effective i would not buy this product again  ,Positive
i felt like it didn t do anything to my hair and it left a film that i hate in my hair  not my fave suave product ,Negative
 years of powerlifting have left the insides of my hands calloused  but those never bother me   but  when callouses started to form on the outer edge of both feet  i realized how aggravating and painful a simple callous can be   for years  i did the   manly   thing and used nail clippers to clip away at the hardened skin   the angle was difficult to reach  often resulting in the accidental clipping of non calloused skin  not fun    rather than continue the unnecessary blood letting  i opted to try the profoot pedi rock and stopped butchering the sides of my feet with the clippers what it isthe pedi rock is semi squishy   blob   completely covered in silicon carbide crystal     an avocado shaped  and sized  sanding block for your feet how it worksthe pedi rock s rough surface and oblong shape not only allows a sure grip for hands of all sizes but a variety of filing angles to address large and small surface areas   filing is easy  simply grab the rock and   sand   the calloused area  it can be used wet or dry   while the silicon carbide crystal is rough enough to grind down a callous  it has a rather smooth feel to it   the rock rinses clean with ease the profoot pedi rock s flexibility and odd shape are what make this thing work so well  as it is easy to hold regardless of how vigorously you attack the pesky callous   the rock s fine grit surface allows for snag free   sanding   which leaves the skin feeling smooth  ,Negative
i have searched far and wide for the perfect nail strengthener and this is it  i cannot even explain how amazing this stuff is and it works even the first time you use it ,Positive
 i went into sally s today looking for a product that would help with frizz  but not make my hair look greasy  or on the flip side  sticky   i have fine hair that s semi oily  i was directed toward this product with the assurance that it wouldn t make my hair look greasy   i used a small amount  my hair looks like i haven t washed it in 2 days   this product will be relegated to the deep basket of products under my sink that i ll use if it ever becomes fashionable to look like someone could fry bacon in my hair 45 minutes after i just washed it  ugh                  if i was smart  i d just realize if i m going to use any kind of hair product  i have to pick between greasy and sticky  ,Negative
 i love the moroccan oil treatment that you put in your hair before blow drying as well as their shampoo and conditioner   they are some of the best hair products i have ever used   however  i was not impressed with the restorative treatment   i have used their standard conditioning treatment and like it much better   like i said  the moroccan oil products have been amazingly fabulous  and i would highly recommend them to everyone   it s just that this particular one i found to be disappointing  ,Positive
these r the worst brushes i ever got they r so do stiff u can t even do what u want to do on your nail the brush came off the handle and the paint did too buy cheap get cheap don t buy these at all buyers beware,Negative
the only thing i didnt like about this item is that i was hoping to get a thicker wider brow stencil because thicker brows are in,Negative
 it has very bad smell  and people around can t stand this  i don t know if it works or not  but i stopped using it due to the somplains of my son   ,Negative
helps my eyebrows grow back in but you have to continue using it or they go right back to being thin again ,Positive
 i am enjoying the new  fresh scents that dove has offered in their body washes   this one is nice and fruity but not too heavy i enjoy the dove body washes   they clean well and are smooth  i also think they are very good for shaving as well as washing  ,Positive
ever thing came mixed up and stuff between the the tray when you tried to turn it to the color you want just terrible ,Negative
 all in all i found that using my john frieda frizz ease hair serum  scrunching my hair and letting it dry normally  worked better at giving me a soft curl   it s not as thick and is easier to add more and run it through my hair   i ll stick with that  ,Negative
 pid wrinkle repair is a true and great name for this product  i love it and yes  i recommend it            ,Positive
 i wanted a face cleaning tool that wasn t too scratchy or rough  but this one is too soft   it doesn t feel like there is any scrubbing exfoliating going on at all  and my normally dry skin has started to break out b c it s just not clean enough  ,Negative
 it came off my head really easily  and pulls out a lot of hair with it  though it is very pretty ,Negative
 i am mildly allergic to most herbal essences products  they cause me scalp to break out in sores   but when i saw that they had a &#34 naked&#34  cleansing conditioner  and when i read that it is a competitor to my expensive infomercial cleansing conditioner  i bought it   i thought the &#34 naked&#34  label might mean there are fewer chemicals in it  and thus i would have fewer issues thankfully  i don t seem to be allergic to this cleansing conditioner   that s a good thing   however  a bad thing about this cleansing conditioner is that i don t think i can use it very often because the floral scent is so overpowering that i feel sick when i first pump it into my hand   it gives me a terrible headache   washing it out doesn t help all that much because the scent lingers   ew i tried it cleansing conditioner a few times  and never got accustomed to the floral scent   it is very  very strong as a product  i think this cleansing conditioner is about as effective as a 2 in 1 shampoo   while this product doesn t contain sulfates  so it isn t as harsh as a 2 in 1 shampoo  it isn t effective as a conditioner at all   my hair wasn t left feeling soft in the least   therefore  i d say this is not a competitor for the expensive infomercial cleansing conditioner  ,Negative
i have been using denman forever  i have my own 9 row denman but i bought this for my young daughter whose hair is quite thick  this one is light weight but it has rubberized pad so it styles her hair real easy and well  no tangles  i would recommend this brush ,Positive
 i have tried everything so it wouldn t  be the frizz ball it was when i washed it  i bought that one they sell on tv which works great on thick  hair  but not shoulder length  my thinning  fine hair despaired and it was a constant pony tail time  i bought this and my hair is shiny&straight  and just loving it  my hair dries really fast so i don t need the high heat  ,Positive
 yes   i used it right   yes it did it again and again   there is nothing fabulous about this overpriced pretentious shampoo    if you are buying this i may as well be able to sell you air   works no better than any other shampoo on the market for a lot less ,Negative
 i must say i have tried dozens of products looking for something that will make my dry  brittle  damaged hair look and feel healthy  when i saw this product that claimed to repair damage i figured i would give it a shot  wow  i am amazed at how well this worked for my hair  it it very creamy and doesn t have a very strong smell  which i love  i coated my hair with this and covered with a shower cap  i left this on my hair for 30 minutes than rinsed it off in the shower  even when my hair was wet i could tell that my hair felt softer  after i dried and straightened my hair  eek i know heat is harmful  but i cant stop  it looked amazing  i could not stop running my hands through it  usually when i sleep on my hair it gets so knotty by the morning  when i woke up my hair will still soft and knot free  this has become a staple in my hair care routine and would recommed this to someone who has tried everything under the sun with no results  ,Positive
toxic please pay attention to the ingredients in the things you buy  this is chemical filled unnecessary nonsense  not to mention plastic is bad for the environment and our drinking water on top of the fact that the contents of this soap are bad enough by themselves ,Negative
i enjoy the fact that this product offers both vitamin c and e as its ingredients  it leaves the skin feeling soft and hydrated  this is important for me because during the summer especially my skin gets dry and needs a good moisturizer  i would recommend this product to anyone looking to hydrate their skin and keep it looking healthy ,Positive
this product was a let down for me  it doesn t really work for me  maybe it s because i have waist length hair  first i ruffed dried my hair with my blow dryer as indicated on the youtube tutorial made by hotandflashy  but i didn t like the way it styled my hair  i guess it s all in hair preference and i prefer my long hair straight  i only use it once and didn t like the feel of my hair afterwards  so now this product is just resting in my bathroom closet unused  so to me this product was a waste of time and money ,Negative
 i have very fair  sensitive skin   i also have problems with periodic breakouts   this has helped minimize the breakouts and balance my ph  all without irritating my skin   i use it before applying any other moisturizers or makeup  and periodically throughout the day if i m not wearing makeup but want to avoid oily skin   i love how it feels and how it works and am now keeping it on hand  ,Positive
well after 1 use of these each the sponge material tore and the metal is exposed was cheap yet still not worth it,Negative
 this is truly a great face cream  works wonders from me but bought off amazon and it had that old lotion smell and it made my face burn when i put it on    i do recommend it  just not off here  too old of shelf life      ,Positive
 this is my absolutely favorite color thus far  it is vibrant and bright  but not neon or obnoxious as far as the brand  gelish is by far my favorite of the gel polishes  i don t see myself using any other brand or paying for another manicure as long as gelish keeps producing quality products and great colors  ,Positive
 beautiful  well made  and looks very expensive & is heavy sturdy     whenever i wear it  i get a compliment lol  no joke     ,Positive
 i bought this lotion from my tanning salon when it came out  first too much always came out of the bottle and when the bottle got low it was very difficult to get the product out  and on top of that it wasnt very moisturizing it felt like applying silk to your face and felt like silky powder once applied which is nice but it was obviously just a silicone feeling and i got absolutely no color from it there was no difference what so ever from this product  ,Negative
 very pretty color  nothing was quite like the pic to me  but i love it  and i won t be returning it  very very well made  and a lovely brown color  well cut  too  ,Positive
 the conditioning of this shampoo is quite good  and it never left my hair frizzy or dry  as for the dry scalp prevention or treatment  it works better than a regular shampoo  but not quite as good as one of the dandruff brands that is made for dry scalp  the problem is  those dandruff brands can be hard on the hair  so i used this shampoo every other day  alternating with the harsher brand  and it worked out pretty well  the scent was a bit overpowering  it cleaned the hair well  and i was able to use less so a bottle lasted for a good month  even with my long and thick hair  ,Positive
this cuticule remover ir really good  is very liquid so i use with a cotton ball but is awesome and do what is supposed ,Positive
 i don t know why  but the product i got from amazon almost seems &#34 generic &#34  it did not perform the same  or anywhere near as well  as the dove nourishing oil products i purchased at my local cvs  i wonder what the reason for this is i am very disappointed  ,Negative
 one more over rated and over priced kerastase product   again    one can get the same results w a much  much less expensive product   when something is suppose to add volume   i expect to see real volume   i know it can t do miracles   but dont hype it up and price it up when it does just a mediocre job at best  ,Positive
 i have some mild acne scars and uneven skin tone with slight redness on my cheeks and sides of my nose   i ve been using this product for a few months   it works ok as a serum  but i don t observe improvement in the dark spots and redness   everyone s skin is different  and i m asian  so i can t conclude that it won t be effective for someone else it is worth trying because it s inexpensive  and as i said  works ok as a serum in general  ,Negative
 my wife tried the dove hair styling root spray lift multiple times  hoping to find an inexpensive alternative to what she currently uses  she was very disappointed with this product  saying it just makes her hair feel heavy and look dirty  she has had great success with the more expensivetoni&guy  casual sculpting powder  she is throwing out the rest of this  ,Negative
 i  have mature sensitive skin and i added this and the night cream at the same time  if there isn t enough moisture for you  you can add a moisturizer that can be used over both the day and night  this has been a good choice for me with two weeks for great results i use freeman cucumber peel mask and pomegranate peel mask in the morning  alternate every other day  and a  smoothies  for what was that deep crease between the brow line  no possibility of getting anything in my eyes  the great thing is that all the products are available with amazon prime       even the body cleanser and lotions  i admit it  i do not enjoy  real  shopping as with any new skin care product  be sure to read the directions and do a  patch test   retinol can cause irritation  certainly worth trying  68 years old and daily time total for skin care is 20 minutes or less   ,Positive
 i suffered from a rash  eczema  i think  and was trying different things to help  i am not exaggerating when i say that maybe a couple of hours passed after using this soap and my rash was already diminishing   i have been pretty consistent with using this soap and my symptoms are almost completely gone after using it for a couple of weeks   i am truly amazed and so happy that something so simple and inexpensive could help me so much   i don t exactly know why it works  all i can say is that it did and i will definitely continue to use this long term            update  it took about 3 4 weeks of consistent use and my rash is completely gone   i also noticed that it has helped significantly with my dry skin  i used to have to apply lotion many times a day and still had hands so dry that they cracked and bled  one day i realized that i hadn t used any lotion for weeks and my hands were fine  i m sold  even if this is more expensive than regular hand soap  it s a lot cheaper than buying tons of expensive lotion and other creams to help with the rash  ,Positive
 obsession is one of the few colognes that stays with me for the whole day   i often get compliments from friends and strangers alike   and lastly  my husband loves it  ,Positive
 this stuff did not work for me  only gave a bad smell in my hair but i kept it and just mixed with others oils until it was gone  wasn t worth returning  but i will not purchase again  ,Negative
 i have fine  slightly wavy hair  it painlessly removed my tangles from sleeping  but caused so much static electricity i had to spray it with static guard  very cheap  dollar store quality brush  a little too large so it feels awkward to use  not impressed  ~~~~item received at no charge for my review~~~~ ,Negative
 i used to take this years ago  this last bottle is just not the same  before  i could feel the jump start  no jitters  no crash  totally different with this batch  upset stomach  jitters  or nothing at all  maybe buy from a reliable source  there are a lot of fakes on amazon  i hear  ,Negative
 this is real raw unrefined shea butter  i use it in my shea butter recipe for my 4c hair and it mixes very easy with my mixer  it blends very well with coconut oil  castor oil  essential oils  or what ever your preference is  you can store it in a zip lock bag or plastic container easily  it shipped very fast  the price is reasonable for the amount of shea butter you receive and i will purchase again when i run out for i have had a lot of hair growth retention these past 4 months  2 inches  and i believe it is due to my shea butter recipe and because i am using this shea butter instead of the yellow  ,Positive
 i purchased this because they were some good reviews on you tube about it  however it did not work for me  i found that it flaked throughout the day on me  the mascara itself was very dry like  it wasn t wet like  and since it was dry like  it clumped on me super fast  and also i got waterproof but somehow it smudged in the outside corners of my eye anyway  since then i have found the best mascara i love the rimmel scandal eyes mascara in the neon orange tube love love love ,Negative
 i tried this relaxer for the first time recently and as far as the end result goes  my hair came out very nice   however  this relaxer burned really bad   it burned my scalp  my neck  and my ears even though i put vaseline on those areas to help protect my skin   so i don t think i ll be using this relaxer again because i ve used other relaxers that do just as good of a job that don t burn as bad  and are cheaper   ,Positive
 years ago a friend of mine bought this product at macys for $125   i thought she was crazy  but i saw what it did for her face and was amazed   she had scaring from teenage acne that was pretty bad   in about six months her skin was so smooth and the scars were barely noticeable   i use this on my neck and find it has made my skin look smoother  ,Positive
 i apply 1 2 drops and my eye shadow stays put even after a long day  its shocking for me b c usually when i have  eye shadow  some of it fades away since i have oily skin  so deff recommend this product to anyone  ,Negative
 my husband hates using sunscreen as he hate to &#34 slobber&#34  stuff on himself  the spray was a success for him because he just uses it just before leaving the house and it is easy  clean and doesn t leave an oily residue in his hands i was doubtful about the claim of &#34 for men&#34  but he liked the product odor and it did nothing for me  i would not use this product  i recommend this product for those finicky men who hate using sunscreens because of the hassle  ,Negative
 i use this over roc max system  i am seeing results with roc and will continue to use  very inexpensive ,Negative
 this is definitely not for sensitive skin  my skin isn t all that sensitive but it broke me out in these  red  almost chapped patches  i tried this because it s what my dad uses  i usually just use the regular cetaphil cleanser & lotion  ow  my face hurts  ,Negative
opi is a great product   i bought the soft and thin one and it didn t work for me at all  i guess i should ve got the original one  i ended up buying sally hansen hard as nails at target for $2 49 and it s working great  my nails are paper thin and bend backwards and split down the middle and have ridges  they are a mess  especially after taking off my acrylics  i would try the regular   ,Negative
 these are wonderful supplements   you get the perfect dosage in just one pill and they are very easy to swallow and have no weird aftertaste   just after a few weeks of taking these i&#8217 ve noticed a huge difference   my skin feels a lot softer and my nails have gotten a lot stronger and have finally started to grow longer too   great product  great price  and with a great quantity  ,Positive
left a bad residue smell on you after you used it  i use dove all the time but forvsome reason this product just left the worst smelk on your body afterwards,Negative
i received these very fast but i have tried them 3 times and all 3 times in less then two days the tape was already peeling and coming up ,Negative
 need i say more   okay  i think i will    think back to the days gone by when the infamous   jheri curl   was so popular  which by the way  made even the shortest of short hair grow   allow me to explain    everyyone s hair grew because we kept it moisturized & as long as you moisturize the hair & not the scalp so much  it will grow thick & long as long as you nurse feed it like we did those doggone jheri curls   this product is fabulous & smells ls so good ,Negative
 fantastic colour  i did have to chase the delivery but overall i was very happy  i would recommend it to anyone ,Negative
 wow   this gel is great if you want your hair to   a  have no shine whatsoever   b  smell like an herbal field  and i don t mean in a good way  this stuff smells like rancid chamomile tea   c  want a very loose hold with excessive greasiness and no i didn t use too much i ve tried many times with varying amounts  from pea to nickel size  and d  feel like there is an opaque film of gunk on your hair that makes it look worse than if you had just air dried it straight out of the shower   horrible stuff   thank goodness it wasn t too terribly expensive  i am tossing the bottle out   ants will probably attack it in my garbage  the smell is so sickly sweet   for reference  i have 3a type curly hair   what i would recommend for use on my type of hair   redken 08 liquid  versastyler  the old formula  not the new stuff   aquage uplifting mousse  and thermafuse esculpt   these aren t as gunky and filmy  and won t leave you smelling like rancid chamomile tea  ,Negative
 i ve had my hot tools 1 5 inch barrel iron for about 15 years now and thought it would be nice to try a different look   a friend of mine has recommended her styling wand but i know that hers is a smaller barrel that is tapered at the end   i thought what the heck  why not try it pros  i loved the curls and the look that i had once finished   they were smooth and made me think   beachy   cons  it takes a lot longer than my normal curling iron   my hair is down to the back of my bra strap so i have to take small clumps of hair to make it all the way to the bottom of the barrel without overlapping   this makes for a much longer process   also  the glove sucks   you can t hold onto your hair on the barrel without feeling some pain   this means you are more often than not with `unfinished  looking ends since you can only hold on for several seconds until you feel a burn   last  your arms will be tired since this is a two arm process   i ve noticed it s much easier doing my daughters hair than doing my own hair  i like to consider my arms toned but they get tired holding onto the tip of my hair in one hand and the wand in the other when i think about this curling wand i think back to the 1800s when they probably had some cast iron curling wand sitting on the stove heating up then trying not to burn their hands or hair with it   how many times have i had a clamp mark with a standard curling iron the last 15 years   not as many times as i ve had `unfinished  looking ends the last two weeks using the wand   i think i will stick with my standard curling iron for everyday use and break out the remington wand for days that i m looking for a beachy wave  ,Positive
 i makes me angry every time i change the channel and i see cindy crawford and she talks about what a miracle product meaningful beauty is  really   these products are absolutely horrible and if you could prove to me that cindy actually uses this poo than i will eat bulls balls for one week  of course this will not happen so i am good  oh and did i mention what an awful company guthy renker is   they take your credit card and charge it each month and it does not stop until you block them from your credit card company  great marketing though  i will give them that  ,Negative
this is the first time i have tried eyelid primer  i am in my late 30 s and have had skin changes so i thought that the primer would help smooth the shadow and keep it on longer i don t know if all eye primers will do this but this one is a loser for me  it went on smooth but hours later upon looking in the mirror it looked as if my eye lids had huge gobs of foundation that was incredibly cakey looking and flaked off when i rubbed it  this is terrible  i have somewhat oily skin in my eye are so perhaps this is te reason for this problem it may work well on younger perfect skin that just needs something to keep the shadow on longer but i cannot recommend this to anyone  for the price though it may be worth a try  everyone s skin is different ,Negative
 i found this product on amazon at a reasonable price  however  when i went to purchase the price jumped considerably   beware and watch the pricing  ,Negative
 yeah  i know  it s a pouch but these things are great for keeping your soap from melting all over your soap dish  the soap melts in the bag which helps them lather up  and the scratchy fabric is the best for exfoliating rough patches on knees  elbows and heels   i had one i bought from the grocery store that lasted for years but these are nothing like that   my first one broke in less than a week   the bottom of the pouch is held shut with a zip tie and in this case the zip tie snapped which let the soap fall out leaving a long sharp piece of plastic to scratch my legs   that s too bad because i can no longer find this type of soap bag in the grocery drug store  ,Positive
 i generally hate the way my skin feels after i shave and was looking forward to trying a   cooling   post shave gel  thinking it would help reduce the after shave irritation  i used have tried it both in combination with the axe chilled shave gel and with other non chilled shave gels  the result was the same  it hurts axe chilled shave gel hurts  it s not a pleasurable cool but an annoying painful   cold   sensation from the menthol  which apparently when applied to a freshly shaven face feels extra potent  so after trying this post shave gel twice  it has gone in the garbage to be used no more  perhaps i m a wuss  maybe my skin is just sensitive  but i can t imagine somebody would like this stuff  ,Negative
 this is one of the best sellers  it literally looks like i took a little girls pink  crusty lipstick and tried it on as a joke to be funny great seller though  fast shipping  just terrible product  c mon mac    ,Positive
i bought this foundation because it has spf  it goes on smoothly and lasts all day long  i really love this foundation and will continue to purchase it ,Positive
this palette is perfect for people who like to keep the eye makeup light  i have used this everyday since i got it  so many different shades and finishes its wonderful  best thing i got so far ,Positive
 i ordered the copacabana off of the reviews i read b c i wanted it to give my face a glowly look  i love it  however  i must say i was shocked when i saw how small it is  all that for 29 dollars i thought  however  you do only need a very tiny amount so i guess it might last longer then i realize    hopefully  but  yes i love it and i will order more once it is time to get another one  i do wanna try the body illuminator as well  but that is $59 dollars and i m sure the container is small too  i am going to try to use some of this on my legs to see if i like it b c i m sure it s the same product  anyways  i highly suggest trying this  i really don t think anyone can be disappointed  i m 28 years old and am constantly looking for new products that make me look better then ever  ,Negative
 these are good nail forms  i have used them a number of times and like how easy they fit snugly around your nail and more importantly  under your nail  so that excess product from builder gel does not end up caked under your nails and then you have to clean that mess out with an electronic file  i think this product makes doing nail tip extensions with builder gel a lot easier and they last longer as well  ,Positive
 unreasonable of me to think this could work  stupid of me to think this would work  you are either born with correct brows or you aren t  period  ,Negative
 i saw this shampoo in the store and thought i would try it i wet my hair and applied the shampoo  within seconds of massaging this into my hair it felt soo dry  i rinsed it all out  and felt my hair and it stripped my hair of any moisture my hair did not feel hydrated at all    the best example i could compare this to is when you wash your body with a bar of soap and then dry off and then you feel that tight dry feeling on your skin that is how this shampoo was on my hair   i have naturally curly wavy thick hair after i rinsed out the shampoo i applied some alberto v05 conditioning treatment to my hair which brought it back to life  i won t buy this product again  i simply can t recommend buying this product  ,Negative
 i love proactiv but  this seller scammed me big time  after receiving it in the mail i not only realized that the product was a &#34 trial size&#34  not a 30 day supply whatsoever  if that doesn t make it bad enough i was signed into a recurring payment plan with proactiv from this purchase too  who says i have the money in my account for a recurring payment  it s crazy someone can do this without your consent  watch out amazon customers this is the first time i ve ever had a bad experience on this site    ,Negative
 i ordered this from e l f i was so excited when it arrived  soooo many colors  well i promptly cleaned my face added e l f eyelid primer  i love this primer most of all the primers i ve tried even  high end primers  and my excitement fizzled drastically  the pigments are awful  even using a wet eyeshadow brush i had to use a lot to get relatively close to what i wanted for color on my lids  if you want decently pigmented large eyeshadow pallets go with nyx or sephora brand pallets  even for the mere 15$ i paid i wouldn t suggest this item  but i will however regift this to my mother in law hahahaha ,Negative
 hey there   i bought it at a locl store nearby where i live   i have used it 3 times and i love the way my hair looks after i use it  my hair is very thick and it s very difficult to curl it  well    with this little wonder my hair is curly and very gorgeous   the curls are very natural looking  and i coouldn t be more pleased   this is the first steam setter i have ever used   so this may seem a bit biased  lol  anyway i love it and it s very easy for me to use   i gave it a five star review because i m so pleased with the results it gave me  ,Positive
 i love this stuff   makes my mani look great   leaves it so shiny and beautiful   i dont use the base coat  i use a supper adhesion base coat   but this base coat is good too  ,Positive
 i thought this product was all right  i used it mainly on my neck area because it says it can help with firmness  i did notice that my neck area feels more firmer  i also used this on my forehead to help with reducing the appearance of fine lines  my forehead did feel smoother after using adovia mineral lift serum overall  i would give it a try just for it s ability help increase your skin s elasticity and make your skin more firmer received complimentary all opinions expressed here are my own  ,Negative
 i was kind of unsure whether to buy these brushes or not by reading reviews that mentioned they didn t recieve the black pouch as shown in the picture but i was glad to see that mine did   there was a minor error in which one of the brushes didn t come with the plastic protecter   no biggie though   shipping was also very fast   it only took three days   i do really recommend these brushes   ,Negative
 i had a reaction to one of the ingredients  my face started burning and turning red immediately after use  i rinsed my face  but it still burned  it was still burning even after washing my face with my usual cleanser  i like the company and can appreciate their efforts to be environmentally sound  so they get 2 stars instead of 1  but i will never use these again  ,Negative
i was so excited for my eyeshadow pallete and i find it spilled all over mixing almost all of the colors together  if i could i wouldn t give it any stars  if you chooseto buy it you do at your own risk  ,Negative
this should be  a must have in everybodys routine   i cant live without it now   youre going to see and feel a change in your skin inmediatly,Negative
 i received one bar to review  just opening the box and leaving the bar in my shower made the entire bathroom redolent of generic male fragrance for days  it doesn t help that the smell reminds me of clorox  no matter how nice this soap may be for my skin  it s not worth dealing with that overpowering scent  ,Negative
 i wore this perfume about 10 years ago  and had actually forgotten all about until i saw it listed on amazon   the scent is very light  but has great staying power   most things fade on me  but this one remains throughout the day   it s described as a floral scent  but on me i can hint more of the sandalwood and amber   i don t particularly like floral scents  but this one is so unique and subtle   i was so excited that i could get the full size 3 3 oz bottle for around $20 with prime shipping   and the bottle is beautiful  unlike anything else out right now  ,Positive
i have tried many glitter polishes at least 10 and snow globe and techno are my favorites   i brought 5 bottles of snow globe and 5 bottles of techno  one coat is all you need to get a magically affect on any polish you use   getting it off takes a little work but it is so worth it  i even brought this polish to give as gifts   a lot of glitter polishes do go on without creating an inconsistent cover   techno and snow globe each glide on with an even distribution of glitter in one stroke  i love love love it  i guarantee you will be happy with this purchase   no nail polish collection should be without it   it makes any polish look like you have pastel diamonds on your fingers and toes  the picture does not do this product any justice  it does not show the way the fools gold affect that he glitter has in person  it s a must have for special occasions ,Positive
 i have beached blonde & permed hair  very damaged and purchased several keratin products to prevent cutting all my hair off  used this product 3 times and my hair appears to be in better shape than before  soft  silky and no tangling as before  i was plagued by bottom layer knots near my nape  combing them out created additional breakage  highly recommended for a price you can t beat  ,Positive
 sorry  but this one is a bust  the plastic is too hard and not flexible enough  won t stay closed around my hair  can t imagine it working for anyone  ,Negative
 not sure why they recommend this  the instructions say to use gauze  i used gauze it aslso seems safer  easier to feel how much product you have so you dont drip  maybe in your eye  honestly  i threw it out  waste of money ,Negative
the lavender version smells good   it feels good when washing hands   it s not harsh on hands   i would recommend it ,Negative
this just stinks  i got no compliments wearing it  it s too sweet and a foul funny primary scent  i wouldn t even use it as air freshened ,Negative
 this entire line is just wonderful  the therapy stress and tension  bath is an ultra relaxing  clean & fresh smelling blend of bath salts recover from a very stressful day with bath oii  bath salts  or body wash  after an aromatherapy bath like this  have a great night s sleep naturally any of these make a terrific and very appreciated gift forget going to a spa recline in aromatherapy at home   your cares will just melt away    now  what was bothering me                   ,Positive
 have used this each day  sometimes twice per day but  don t see any difference   there are others to choose from  so maybe this particular one is not for me  ,Negative
 i bought this product because apparently julia roberts just   loves it     i ve used better products   while weleda skin food may be all natural  it has a strange smell and leaves a greasy film on my skin   i definitely won t buy it again  ,Negative
after using this i started developing little red pimple like bumps on wherever i used it  i gave it away to my sister i ll just stick with cerave sa it s a better lotion ,Negative
 the nexxus salon hair care dryer is a compact and surprisingly powerful machine   the   italian ac motor   and air tunnel are encased in an off white plastic tapering tube 8 5in long  3 25 in  in diameter at its widest point  the 4 5 in  long handle is curved to fit the hand  right or left hand   a heavy rubber cover protects the electric cord extending from bottom of the handle so excessive wear due to dryer changes in angle can be avoided  the cord is 6 ft  4 in  long  the 110 v plug has built in test reset buttons that act as a circuit breaker if the cord gets too hot  the unit has not overheated while operating the device since i got it the motor is very powerful  blowing air with high power  the tapered tube of the blower has effective   ionic technology   that helps prevent   frizz    a factor i have had some experience with after testing another dryer two years ago  the end of the blower tube has titanium ceramic technology that produces   infrared heat   that i have found does not burn the hair with normal use there are two attachments for the end of the dryer tube  one is a   concentrator    a 3 5 in  wide black plastic funnel with a flattened air exit  this produces an air stream that is wider but more concentrated than the blower tube without the attachment  the second attachment is a round plastic   diffuser   6 in  in diameter that spreads the air out through eighteen 1 25 in  teeth  this works well with long hair to fluff up the hair and create curls and waves the hand controls can be operated easily for left or right handers  there are two black oblong rocker buttons and one round button  the lower black button controls motor speeds  off  low  and high  the upper black button controls air temperature  cool  warm  and hot  the round button set high on the handle is an off on cold button  with one push and release the machine will blow cold air without changing the temperature setting controlled by the upper black button  a second push and release of the round button will return the air to the setting of the upper black button my wife uses the nexxus dryer frequently and likes the machine very much  we asked a friend  a hair salon owner  to try it out in her shop  she likes the power of the machine  the functioning of the handle controls  and the effectiveness with her styling work i highly recommend the nexxus salon hair care dryer for its compact design  powerful motor  and functionality for personal and professional use  ,Positive
 i bought this to use when i go to the beach   it s organic  mostly  but it contains talc   didn t they decide talc was really bad for you in the 70 s   not sure if that s what burns my skin or what   there s no paraben in it  but it still burns my eyes   i jumped into the ocean    that was a huge mistake   my eyeballs burned for like an hour   i won t purchase this again  ,Negative
 i may not have truly understood what i was getting when i selected this  but it was horrible  thick and greasy and nearly impossible to wash out i think it may not be meant for my hair type  pretty normal  not oily or too dry  dark caucasian hair  it just didn t seem to do anything other than create a gross icky mess for me  ,Negative
 the good   the scent is fairly pleasant  and if you re not a big fan  it s light enough where it s not going to overwhelm you the bad   it feels like i have an infinitely thin layer of some sort of grease on my skin that seems it would be better used as waterproofing than as a moisturizer   once the grease feeling wears off  my skin feels no better than prior to having it on   as others commented  some of the ingredients chemicals aren t exactly stuff you want rubbing all over yourself the suggestion   get a more natural moisturizer   cocoa butter is good overall   the claim that this stuff &#34 hydrates & smoothes  illuminates & brightens&#34  is absurdly wrong   usually  a so so product like this would get a so so rating of 3 stars   however  based on the overzealous claims that didn t pan out at all  so there goes another star i d keep looking for a &#34 body cream&#34  or moisturizer or whatever you want to call it   cause this stuff is no better than stuff i ve used for half or even a third the price  ,Positive
this color is a grey plum  it went on with two coats and lasted almost 3 weeks   this would make a very nice fall color ,Positive
 this is fantastic if you have dry skin  if you don t mind an earthy scent  this stuff is perfect  you only need a little of it to go along way as well so don t be too intimidated by the price   this is also a good way to get a guy to use lotion if he s stubborn about it   ,Positive
 i took my time and researched if this was a good product  it wasn t bad  22 dollars but i wanted one that i wouldnt waste time  money and hopes on  it has been 2 weeks and my bags are still there  waiting to be unpacked  so to speak i am thinking of trying the loreal one that another reviewer recommended  also there is a cheaper version at walgreens  their studio 35 version for 15 dollars and there is also the garnier one  i will try them next week or 2 weeks from now  i will keep using the roc  and i will update this review  ,Negative
 don t order this if expecting to be full cover nails to just glue  paint and wear   they are tips and very disappointed with the purchase  ,Negative
 i can not say much more about this stuff that has not already been said  it stinks  it has bad ingredients    this company seeks to trick people by using the name   organic   instead of actually being organic  i will not be supporting them in their trickery    off to the trash   ,Negative
this is a wonderful serum for both men and women alike  my hubby has been using it along side of me for weeks and we are very pleased with the results  i love the feel and texture  you can t beat the price for this fountain of youth in a bottle ,Positive
 i like that the eye cream is in a jar instead of a pump  those pumps tend to squeeze out too much  this eye cream was a good moisturizer  but that was the only benefit  it did not reduce the dark circles under my eyes  and i have been using this product for about two months  not visible difference  would not purchase again  ,Negative
i was super excited to try this sunscreen for my young kids and myself as i have been searching for a good chemical free sunscreen  well despite the chemical free claim on the front of the bottle just read the label  there s tons of them in there  it s quite expensive and i got burned using it at the beach despite frequent re application  seventh generation is the way to go for a truly natural sunscreen ,Negative
 these chalk are totally great   what an amazing selection  it s almost hard to choose which ones to try first   i followed the directions and had no luck   i was bummed and figured it was because i have brown hair and it wasn t going to work for me   so  i read the other reviews and first styled my hair how i like it and then picked a chalk  dipped it in a bowl of water for about five seconds and it practically painted on my hair   so easy   i used three colors  pink  turquoise and yellow   the first two were perfect but i had to work the yellow a bit more to get it to show as well  dark hair    i can t feel it when i touch my hair and it looks so great   i did not wear gloves  yes  i should have  but the color washed right off i have used the spray can of blue on my hair before and there isn t a lot of control plus  it made my hair look dull   this is the opposite   goes where i want and  it is bright this is an ideal product for anyone that wants to have a bit of fun and or express yourself through color  ,Positive
 well  there s not much negative to say about this sunscreen  perhaps the price is a little high   but overall  it s an excellent sunscreen that s easy to apply  has no fragrance  and lasts a couple of hours   summer s coming and my wife and i will both be using this around the pool   hopefully the price will drop some  ,Positive
 i purchased this in a set and must say was disappointed in the results   it was packaged beautifully and could not wait to use it so i shampooed that night and conditioned my hair   i sprayed in the cd leave in and my hair only felt wet with a strong smell of vanilla   it did not detangle all that well and i did not feel as though my hair was moisturized after using it   it was like spritzing vanilla scented water in my hair more than conditioning   after blow drying  my hair felt stripped and looked rather dry   not a fan of cd and will not purchase again  ,Negative
 it s not as a handy device as expected  so be aware  and better not buy it  i won t order it again  ,Negative
 now this review is going to be in two parts  the first part is going to be about how nice the product looks & feels on my skin  the second is going to be about the product s design & packaging as advertised  this blush looks great on me  i chose this product because my powder compact matched one of the   true matches   for this color & since i m not that skilled in picking out blushes  i liked that it was an easy choice  the product is easily blended & feels very light on my skin now for the bad part of the review  the packaging & design  it s horrible  i had to look to 2 stores before i found a blush compact where the powder wasn t smashed up  the first store s compacts had one that was physically damaged so i assumed that the powders were smashed up due to improper handling during transit  the 2nd store i went to had the blushes in both damaged & undamaged conditions  again  i assumed this was due to improper handling during transit  i purchased my blush & went on about my life  then when i returned home  the compact fell off of a very short coffee table to the ground  no more than 10 inches in height  it fell onto not only a padded carpet floor but also a nice thick rug on top of that floor  so it s not like it fell onto a hard surface  and guess what  the compact s powder was completely smashed up the delicateness of the powder doesn t hurt the look of the makeup  but it does make it far less convenient for me to put on when i m on the go  i also have to watch to ensure that i don t put too much on due to it being in a now loose powder form   it s easy to get more on then you bargained for   as a result i use it far less than i would have if it wasn t loose & i doubt that i ll purchase this again when this expires or runs out  unless you treat your cosmetics like they re fragile children  i don t really recommend this product  ,Negative
i was a little scared a first thinking anything with a lot of needles on it rolling over my skin would hurt alot  didn t hurt at all  just a tingling sensation where you roll it if you press to hard into the skin then it does hurt  i ve noticed that my problem areas on my face have been looking better since using this i m going to be trying it out on a few scars on my legs next and will give the results later  i will normally use this then afterwards use a toner or vitamin c serum right after  the combination has been working for me  i d recommend buying one and giving it a try  don t let the needles scare you away from a great product  will be recommending this to family & friends ,Negative
 i am blessed to have a 50+ year old wife who still looks 30  and people are always asking her how she looks so young   her answer is obagi and she cannot imagine life without it   here in texas  many of the obagi products are virtually by prescription or completely banned  so mail order is the only way to get them and at a reasonable price  ,Positive
 great idea for a color enhancer in red but it just did not work on my hair  the red did dye my scalp and all around my finger nails  i  washed my hands  but it stuck around my nails on the cuticles  didn t like it  ,Negative
this cleanser is excellent  very gentle on the skin  i love that it is paraben free  i use it on my acne prone skin and love it ,Positive
 this brand never disappoints  it does not disturb the natural skin ph and cleanses with a wonderful mild lavender aroma   comes in a 2 pack  perfect for each bathroom  one of the best quality gels on the market  ,Positive
 i recently put this on my  wish list  on amazon and my husband purchased it for me along with the facial cleansing milk  i absolutely love both  they make my face soft  hydrated  and clean  this serum is a pump  which makes applying it very easy  i am very into fitness and healthy eating  and now i m taking it further and taking care of my skin  i am moving away from harsh chemicals and i m thankful i turned to avalon organics  ,Positive
 i always use a hot air brush after my frizzy hair is 1 2 way dry  my old 1 is on it s last leg so i got this one  i used it  twice and i do like it   it work well  but as long as my old favorite 1 works i will use it i ,Positive
 terrible where to begin first a list of ingredients mineral oil  hyrogenated coconut oil  hyrogenerated styrene butadiene copolymer  palm oil  fragrance  bht  shea butter  trticum vulare  wheat germ oil  sweet almond oil  sunflower seed oil  soybean oil  argania spinosa kernal oil  & last but not least aloe leaf juice there is no possible way this product is going to   provides light  non greasy nourishment to scalp & hair   yet that is exactly what is says on the bottle second the instructions for use are   hip   but vague  1  cleanse 2  smooth  3  sooth 4  seal i went online for further clarification and found nothing but a spectacular ad campaign with a beautiful model and her  amazing hair  so i decided to experiment i figured my first use would be the same way one would use v05 hair oil  a great product  by the way   i would wash my hair  forgo conditioner  rub in the oil and rinse  if this was too light then i would on my second application wash  rub in oil and leave it in i never got to the second experiment after only washing my hair  applying a dose of no more than a teaspoon  seriously a little goes a long way   and then giving my hair a rinse and patted my hair out with a towel  one and a half hours later  my hair is fairly thick & goes to the middle of my back   my hair was dry but appeared  matted & greasy to the eye as well as to the touch  i looked like i had laquered my head  i could not wash my hair fast enough  oddly upon my second hair washing my hair had achieved a pleasant level of softness  shine and a visible improvement in my split ends  but at a very gross price v05 is by far a less troublesome and superior product  i believe i ll stick with that and avoid this one and i can not recommend this product as nothing more than a great lubricant for perhaps sliding a tight ring off a swollen finger  ,Positive
 some people can t tolerate the chemical sun screens  so for those people  this may be an option   the active ingredients in this product are titanium dioxide 8% and zinc oxide 3 8% the cream looks tan and opaque as it comes out of the tube and i worried it would look funny on my face but it does blend in and you can t see it my complaint is how it feels   i don t like the way it feels on my face   i was expecting it to soak in more but i touch my face and it feels greasy   i m going back to the more typical sun screens  ,Negative
waste of money   gave me cysts and didn t clean my pores   threw it out   and i own many bb products    but this one stinks   literally ,Negative
 i love this product  the brow pencil is the perfect shade and the high light is great  it is great to shape your eyebrows  and make them pop  ,Positive
 pros smells nicedoesn t clog poresoil freecons way too hydratingi have oily skin and since it said oil free on the back  i figured i might be ok    i woke up with basically an oil slick on my face  i used it for about a week and it s just way too hydrating  it feels non greasy but it causes my face to produce so much oil it smells great and would probably be great for someone with drier skin  but definitely not for me  right now i m just using it on my neck and hands so i would at least get something out of it lol ,Negative
 the colors start out nice at application and the marker makes them easy to apply however as a stain it falls short  it dried my lips  even wearing lip balm didn t help  i didn t have as much of an issue with bleeding but it does fade when in contact with liquids which would be an issue if you lick your lips  it also seemed to get darker the longer i wore it and it feathered which i was sure was something a lip stain shouldn t do i wouldn t say it s a &#34 you get what you pay for&#34  situation because i usually love most e l f  products i have tried but this was definitely not one of them  ,Positive
 be careful with this brand  even though they state they are natural and contains no glycols  this product does contain glycols which  they try to hide in the ingredient list by listing it with natural components  please look carefully at the ingredients and make sure you are not spending more money for this product which doesn t contain all natural ingredients  ,Negative
 these scissors are okay  but they kind of hurt my fingers when i use them for a while  they would be better if they had like a rubber grip or something so they don t dig into my fingers  ,Negative
 i dont have wrinkles near my eyes  just tired eyes from insomnia  but i do have those parenthesis around my mouth  i used these on both my eyes anyway and around the mouth and now i have eye wrinkles and the lines around my mouth are more pronounced  wtfreak  thankfully they were inexpensive  ,Negative
 this thinned out my seche vite topcoat fine  took a couple more drops than i anticipated but it served its purpose  ,Positive

 i have been looking for a product for my daughter  who had a few acne scars that were much darker then her skin color  we tried so many products amongst them the high rated bio oil  which for her did not work i use the reviva firming serum and saw this brown spot treatment at a local beauty store and decided to try it  within just a couple days we already see a difference  finally a product for an affordable price that works highly recommend it     ,Positive
 this product is quickly becoming my go to razor   for a long time i have used other brands of razors with limited comfort   i have used other razors that require a battery  and promise a smoother shave  but i think that this razor provides more comfort in a simpler razor than do other similar products this version of the hydro provides a disposable type razor  no replaceable head  and is great for travel  or even everyday use   the hydro strips on the razor provide a clean smooth shave without and help to hydrate dry skin   i personally hate shaving for this reason  the drying out of the skin and the irritation it causes  but this product really helps to control that over time i am becoming more and more of a fan of the hydro brand  and am slowly becoming a loyal customer   i have found that this razor provides a smoother shave than does its competitors  its multiple shaving heads and hydrating formula feel good during and especially after the shave   it has a flexible head for corners  and you can flip back the top portion of the razor for close edging this is my favorite disposable razor  ,Positive
 i am surprised by how much i didn t like this foundation  or the corresponding powder paula begoun rates this stuff pretty high  it is a   paula s pick    so i thought it would be great unfortunately  even with a primer under it  my pores looked huge  the color   matched   to my skin by the color match chart is n1  which is really too light for my complexion  i need to put bronzer over the foundation to keep from looking goulish this can t be used around the eyes because of the spf in the product causing irritation  and it seriously emphasizes lines under the eyes  too the matching powder was too cakey  also the only good things i can say are 1  the product does have spf  and 2  it was cheap enough for me to not feel all that bad about throwing it in the trash  ,Negative
 i should say first that i am a nexxus junkie   about 3 years ago my hairdresser  whom i used to see infrequently  washed my hair with nexxus once and i fell in love with the smell  so i decided to buy some shampoo and conditioner   eventually i discovered nexxus emergencee restorative strength conditioning treatment and was using it for about 2 years with what i thought were decent results   until i found this   i have developed a system and i truly believe that this reconstructor is the real deal i use this product in conjuction with so many other nexxus products and i ll give you a run down of everything i do below   i will warn all you readers  though about each product   be prepared  this is a long review  but informative nexxus therappe shampoo   it smells great and i really have no complaints   i havent used any other nexxus shampoo  so i dont have much to compare it to nexxus humectress conditioner  deep  hydrating treatment   this is awesome   i have tried other nexxus conditioners  nexxus humectress ultimate moisturizing conditioner  nexxus keraphix restorative strengthening conditioner  and nexxus hyrda sleek silken smoothing conditioner  but none compare to the moisturizing power this stuff has nexxus pro mend overnight treatment cr&egrave me   at first this seemed like the answer to my split end prayers   it truly  truly does repair split ends   however  it took my curly wavy hair  think halle berry in their eyes were watching god movie  to bone straight hair   seriously  you cannot find half a curl in my hair   obviously  it changes the structure of your hair when it binds the split ends  so be warned if you have curly hair this may very well change your hair s structure   since it worked so well for me  i continue to use it only on my ends while i allow my curls to grow back   for my african american readers  it looks like a perm is growing out of my head  curly wavy at the roots and straight on the ends   i press my roots and flat iron my hair for work anyway so i dont look too funny now the reason why you are here  nexxus polymedic emergency reconstructor   having used nexxus emergencee reconstructor i am familiar with protein treatments and the effects on my hair   let me be frank  this blows other reconstructors clear out of the water   i ve used  stinky  aphogee keratin reconstructor and it doesnt even compare   i learned the hard way that too much protein  as this product is super strength and can easily deliver  will cause your hair to break   after just 2 applications of this product on my entire head   it caused my edges to break off   that is how strong this is   like i said previously  i had been using emergencee for 2 years and had never had any breakage  but just 2 applications of this stuff and my hair was looking very rough around my edges   i should mention also  that during my first 2 applications of this product i left it on for 30 minutes at a time  once a week   the directions recommend just 10 minutes every 2 weeks   i stopped applying it to my edges and they recovered in just 2 weeks or so   all in all  as long as you dont overdo it you will see great results   if you re not asleep yet  keep reading to learn about the steps i take every week to acheive really healthy hair 1   wash my hair with nexxus therappe shampoo2   allow my hair to air dry until it is only slightly damp and apply nexxus pro mend overnight treatment cr&egrave me and leave it in overnight 3   wash out the promend and apply nexxus polymedic emergency reconstructor on my entire head  except my edges    cover with a shower cap and leave on for 10 15 minutes 4   wash out the reconstructor and apply nexxus humectress conditioner  deep  hydrating treatment to slightly damp hair   cover with a shower cap for about an hour  while i clean my bathroom or do laundry or something domestic 5   rinse out the conditioner and allow my hair to air dry naturally 6   heat style my hair   press the roots and edges and use an electric flat iron to straighen my hair the results after a day and a half  every weekend     of repeating this process  my hair is probably the shiniest and bounciest hair you will ever see  it is so soft and healthy  you could run your fingers through it and not hit a snag at all   as a black woman it feels great when non black people compliment me on my hair   not any of those well meaning  yet  condesceding remarks such as    your hair is so cool   or   wow  i wish my hair could be like that    i get    wow  your hair is so pretty   and   how do you get your hair so soft     seriously  i have shared my procedure with all my friends and family   although they dont have the dedication or income to buy all the above mentioned products  they have seen some results update  9 6 12after doing some extensive research  brought on from reading the science of black hair by audrey davis sivasothy   i ve realized that although my hair appeared very healthy  it was suffering from too much protein   this product has large amounts of protein and although that s great for your hair  too much is obviously a bad thing   i ve learned what the warning signs are for too much protein and i had to come back and share this with you readers 1   protein is supposed to bond with your hair   while you are using this treatment this should make your hair hard  with or without heat    if your hair is still soft  while this product is on your hair  after a reasonable amount of time  it s not binding   that s enough protein  2   too much protein causes your hair to become hard and brittle   no matter how much conditioner  moisturizer  or oil you put on your hair   if it s still hard or crunchy or breaks when you barely touch it while dry   that s enough protein  3   when you start to see breakage  that s the final straw   you will see breakage mostly at the roots  as this is the healthiest hair on your head since its the newest    your roots are already strong and dont really need that much protein   if you see breakage at your roots or very close to your scalp   that s enough protein  if you ve got too much protein be sure to clarify your hair and give it some time to recover from the protein treatments good luck to all  ,Negative
 when i first revived this product in the mail  i initially put the package unopened on the kitchen table  after an hour the whole kitchen had a very strong scent that was starting to drift into adjoining rooms   when i finally opened it up  even though the container itself was wrapped plastic  a wall of smell rushed over me   when i opened up the plastic  i understand why it was double wrapped  it was leaking   but the cap was not accidentally open in transit  the bottle is so poorly designed  that some will leak out if it is on its side  which of course will happen if you have it shipped the body wash is your slightly above average body wash   the scent is a bit strong  but not that overpowering when you use it  nor is it the most pleasant scent i have ever used  do not ask me why deep space  chill out means   i do like that it has the micro beads that helps give you that extra clean   if you like other axe products  you may want to give a try at wherever you buy beauty products in a brick and mortar store  but do not buy this over the internet because the design alone will guarantee that it will leak  ,Positive
 when buying any product or thing online  you run the risk of getting a bad batch  i got a vary bad batch  it was grainy and lumpy  not smooth at all  i ve been using shay butter in my hair for three years now  and it has never looked like what i got  well ill be sticking to buying them at my local beauty supply store  this product was so bad  that i had to trow it out   never ordering shea butter online again  ,Positive
 i bought this in may of 2012   this nail dryer is supposed to be an led nail dryer but took 2 4 minutes per coat of gelish nail products   i used to have a uv dryer that took that long   i have since returned this one for a refund and bought a red carpet led nail dryer   it was less than half the cost  it s small and compact and it worked in 30 90 seconds per coat   cut my gel manicure time in half   it quit working after a few uses  though and i have just contacted the supplier  beauty in style   they are going to replace or give me a full refund   in their e mail  they mentioned having addressed the issue  with the defect i guess  and i believe i ll try the red carpet again  ,Negative
 lemon zest  herbs  and an undefinable something that is just sublime  the fragrance of this product is divine   the texture of this scrub is excellent  too   it s not hugely gritty  nor clumpy the way a lot of facial scrubs are that come in a jar   it doesn t take much to work  either   it s best used after regular cleansing  i found   i ve been using it with a clairisonic type gadget   and it  s a verrrrrry pleasant experience that i look forward to   mmmmmmmm    fingertips should work just fine as well  and the more you work it  the more of that heavenly aroma is released   i m tempted to dab some under my nose so i can smell it all day like all facial exfoliating scrubs worth the name  this vi tae product left my skin soft  smooth  and ready to accept treatment   after using it at night  my morning skin looks and feels great my only complaint is that the dispenser built into the top of the bottle didn t work for me   the product comes in a flexible container so it s not a big deal to squeeze out the right amount   i ve dropped a lot of glass cosmetics in my day  and love that this one comes in plastic i m thrilled with the product which vi tae provided for review   if they d just come out with a fragrance like this one  i d be their first customer edited on 4 24 my bottle of get refreshed fell off the counter and crashed into the sink   the top part of the lid popped off and is now working perfectly   i m not suggesting anyone else fling bottles around the bathroom  even if they are plastic    but the initial lid failure was caused  i believe  by the extraordinarily secure shipping packaging  the top part of the cap must ve gotten wedged   it s fine now  and i continue to love this product  ,Positive
 this hydroxatone scrub does a nice job of cleansing and leaving my skin feeling fresh and exfoliated  it has a bare  but pleasant  scent to it  to call it microdermabrasion might be a bit of a stretch  but it does work as well as any other facial scrub i have tried the jar that the product comes in is somewhat small  for the price   and i don t particularly like sticking my finger in the jar  preferring the types of products that come in a tube to avoid this  the consistency is pretty thick so this may be why it comes in a jar rather than a tube  it doesn t take a lot of product to get a good result  though  and it rinses very easily while my face felt soft and clean  i m not sure that it will provide better results than your average  much less expensive  drug store brand scrub  at least so far  i am not   transformed    but happy enough with glowing skin  ,Positive
quality of the clips and sewing is great  strong but hair is thin  not too crazy about the thin hair since i already have that problem naturally  price was too good to be true ,Positive
i was paying double for the same thing on tv  got this at a much better price and can not tell the differance good deal ,Positive
 i like to take a break from foundation but still want my skin to look good  this product provides a fresh finish and spf 15 sun protection   out of the tube it looks more like foundation than other bb creams i ve tried and i was concerned that the color would be too dark for my fair skin  but those concerns were quickly allayed  the product applies smoothly leaving my skin looking and feeling fresh and smooth  it enhances  covering small imperfections and evening tone  it does not feel heavy or greasy and i suffered no reactions to it  there is a light  floral fragrance  i prefer unscented cosmetics but the fragrance does diminish  this is a quality product at a reasonable price  if you want to look polished without the heavy foundation  this cream is worth a try  recommended  ,Positive
i bought this because i read that nars made long lasting lip gloss but this product is just like any other lip gloss to me stays on for maybe one hour or so ,Negative
love the look of these over other colors   used the blue first over gold yellow glitter for st  paddy s day and got green glitter   awesome ,Positive
 i have very large pores on my nose and i used it for months  no change in pore appearance  but it smells peachy and nice  it was worth a try since it was relatively inexpensive  shipping took about a week  ,Negative
 i was hoping for a lotion with results  but the only result i got was flaming red skin that was hot and itchy  i would not recommend  ,Negative
 as a self proclaimed beauty addict  read i spend way too much on products  i can honestly say i am not impressed at all with this soap  i purchased it based on reviews for how nice it smells  personally the smell is ok  not suberb  not knock glam up a notch  just ok i can get ok from drugstore soap for a lot less it lathers fine but as for it moisturizing i felt it was lacking and i wouldn t run out and re purchase  i had that dry bar soap film type of feel afterwards i found it to be just another bar soap  with an ok scent  an ok lather and that s absolutely it  i m going to stick with my zum soaps  they smell incredible and i m much more pleased with their moisturizing qualities over this brand  ,Negative
 so i thought i d try wen as i d seen the infomercials and was looking for a product that was more natural and wouldn t dry out my hair   i followed the instructions for use to the tee  on the plus side i liked the smell  very minty and clean  and i liked how my hair felt in the shower  very silky and soft   however  after i blow dried and styled as usual i noticed that my hair looked kind of dull  had little body and felt dirty  so for me this product most definitely did not live up to the hype   for the price  i would expect fantastic looking hair instead of hair that looked like it hadn t been washed in 3 days   today i went back to my old shampoo and conditioner and my hair looked and felt much better   i definitely would not buy this again  it s not worth what you pay for it   thankfully i bought this here on amazon and so did not get sucked into the auto shipment program   ,Negative
 never ever again would i put this on my hair  for one thing  i needed at least 30 pumps  i was able to use this a few times before the pump broke  i used this thinking i wasn t going to see results over night  even though that s the claim  i was patient and continued to use it  it left my hair feeling dry and not conditioned  it smelled ok  but that didn t make up for the fact that it just didn t do any good to my hair  the directions said for extra effect  leave a little on as a leave in conditioner  i tried that once and once my hair dried it looked as if i hadn t washed my hair for weeks  so each time i rinsed it out  following the directions to rinse for a few minutes  it was a waste of money and the claims made of what it will do for your hair are false  ,Negative
i absolutely love this flat iron  i have been looking for a flat iron that can handle my thick roots  this iron is the business ,Positive
 not correct color for me  not thick enough to cover properly  disappointed would not suggest this product  nor would i get it again  ,Negative
this hair clip is very light weight  it s not at all what i expected  i wouldn t recommend this one ,Negative
 this is the most make up friendly face cream ever  it goes so well with sunscreen and foundation  i have combination skin  it looks a bit greasy the first 15 seconds you put it on  but after that it absorbs quickly and totally  will buy again  ,Positive
 i know this was made for men  but i went ahead and decided to give them a try   after using them for a few weeks this is what i have determined the handle is thick and comfortable in the hand   i find that the 5 blades is a bit much  and not being a large female   the head of the razor was awkward to get the armpits with   i had less trouble with the legs and actually found that the lotion part of the razor allowed me to finish shaving my legs even after running out of shaving cream and did not end up with razor burn   it s not something i would try on a regular basis but it was nice to be able to finish both legs   i really don t see any benefit to adding 2 more razors into the mix  maybe that s a guy thing   i do know that the prices as of the time of my writing this   is very good in compared to other makes and models of razors   if the price continues to be equal to or lesser than other razors of the same class  i wouldn t hesitate to make the purchase   i would not however pay more for them  ,Negative
 after only 2 weeks of use  i have noticed a substantial improvement to my skin  the most remarkable improvement was around my eyes with the skin seemly tightening up and an overall smoothness and healthiness to my face  at 58  anything that can help with the overall appearance is welcomed and this product works  after years of abuse  it is amazing how the hands of time can be reversed i have been told that this particular product is the best there is on the market and so far  would have to agree  the only issue i have had and it certainly isn t a deal breaker is there is a stickiness after using the serum on my hands  i just need to give them a good wash before doing anything else as i got the top to the tube sticky the first time  however  a very small price to pay for the incredible results in addition to the stated benefits i appreciate the fact that this product is priced at a great deal  plus the fact this is as pure a hyaluronic acid serum on the market  i am going to stock up on it before these guys realize what they are doing  excellent product that works at an excellent price  i m more than happy with it  ,Positive
 i love doing my nails  and these plates are currently my favorites  with most of them the areas of a given design are large enough to allow you to pick different parts of it  giving you matching nails that aren t cookie cutter identical  the one exception is the plates where the designs are in narrow bands or arches  still trying to figure out how i should use those  ,Positive
 i like to have a moisturizer on my face  during the day  and night moisturizer at night   i really like the way my face feels with this moisturizer   it s not greasy or shiny at all for my typically oily skin in the   t   zone   the spf 15  will help keep my aging skin  from getting more age spots   i put a little makeup on over it and am happy for how my face looks for hours  if not all day   i put it on my neck and upper chest too   works well to keep those fast aging areas looking good  ,Positive
i received this item and can t even use it because there is no straw that goes down into the water to spray up with  now i will have to go and buy a travel sized spray bottle  is it even the real product  now i wonder ,Negative
 i was sceptical when i ordered this   i don t usually buy palettes this big and definitely not from an unknown manufacturer   i am a label whore and can t live without my palettes from too faced and urban decay   i liked that they were very highly pigmented  almost too pigmented  if that even makes any sense    it takes a very light hand to use these colors  being careful not to end up looking clownish   the only complaint i had was that they seem so brittle   one swipe with a brush or a applicator and they seem to disintergrate and you end up with eyeshadow powder everywhere   the colors do last long on  i use an eyeshadow primer  and look true till the end of the day   this is a great buy  very good deal for the price  ,Positive
 don t believe all the hype about this one  nothing great  at all  usual &#34 serum&#34  like scores of them  useless ones  on the market  not going to reduce any wrinkles or make you look any better than  any typical cream in a drugstore  ,Positive
 i have shoulder length hair  and had to use all 20 rollers   it doesn t show when the rollers are hot enough  tho it says it heats up quickly   what s quickly   4 minutes  or one hour there is no place for the plastic clips  so you need a showcap or something to hold the plastic clips   in other words  make sure you have lotsa room for storing the big clunky heater and the clips so i got a perm  thinking it would hold the curl longer  but it s still the same   curl out in 3 4 hours  and i left the rollers in for about a half hour  hoping that would help keep a curl other such curlers have a ready dot on the top so you can see when each roller is ready to use   the directions didn t say anything except it heats up quickly  not much else see photo of all the clips you need to store somewhere  ,Negative
